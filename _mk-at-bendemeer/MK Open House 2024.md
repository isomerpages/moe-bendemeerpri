<h3><strong>ON TO A STRONG START! </strong></h3><p>Dear Parents, </p><p>Are you looking for a quality and affordable kindergarten programme for your preschool child?</p><p>At MOE Kindergarten, we believe that children are joyful, curious, active and competent learners and we are committed to giving every child a strong start. Our holistic curriculum and programmes nurture children’s confidence, social skills, bilingualism and build a good foundation in literacy and numeracy. </p><p>Our curriculum is developed by MOE’s curriculum specialists and trained educators with knowledge and experience in early childhood education and who are familiar with the primary school curriculum. Your child will embark on an exciting learning journey through our two flagship programmes – the HI-Light Programme and the Starlight Literacy Programme for English and Mother Tongue Language. These programmes focus on the holistic development of children and seek to ignite the joy of learning in them. </p><p>Should you require a full-day service for your child, we also offer Kindergarten Care (KCare) at all MKs. If you register, your child will be in KCare before and after the MK session, providing a full-day programme for your child within the same premises.</p><p>At the physical Open House 2024, parents are welcomed to tour the learning environment and speak to the MK educators in person.
