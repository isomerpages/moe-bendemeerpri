<p>Our outdoor curriculum promotes <strong>holistic child development through purposeful play </strong>in
both natural and thoughtfully designed outdoor spaces. Children engage
in a range of activities like <strong>Unstructured and Structured Play, YES! Day, Let’s Find Out sessions, as well as playground and wheeled vehicles experiences. </strong>These
activities support physical development, creativity, independent thinking,
and environmental awareness.</p>

<p>Through a spectrum of teacher-guided, teacher-child shared and child-initiated
learning, MK@Bendemeer fosters learning dispositions from the NEL framework: <strong>Perseverance, Reflectiveness, Appreciation, Inventiveness, a Sense of Wonder, and Engagement. </strong>Outdoor
learning plays an important role in our curriculum as it nurtures children
into confident leaders, passionate learners and members of a gracious community.</p>
<h4>Playground &amp; Wheeled Vehicles Time</h4>
<p>Our Playground and Wheeled Vehicles time focuses on nurturing the disposition
of <strong>Engagement</strong>, where children are deeply interested and
actively involved in learning as they interact with the materials. During
this time, they enjoy learning and playing alongside their friends in a
joyful and meaningful way.</p>

<h4>Let’s Find Out</h4>

keen interest in the world around them. They are confident in asking questions
and enjoy exploring, investigating, and discovering new things.</p>

<h4>YES Day!</h4>
<p>Our YES Day programme nurtures children’s <strong>inventiveness</strong> by
encouraging flexible thinking and creative problem-solving. Children are
provided with a variety of resources and given the autonomy to choose the
materials they wish to explore and how they engage with them.</p>

<h4>Structured Play</h4>
<p>Our Structured Play programme helps children develop <strong>perseverance</strong> as
they work towards completing tasks despite challenges. Through teacher-directed
games and activities such as skill-focused relays and group games with
rules, children learn to stay engaged and resilient. Structured Play may
also serve as an extension of our HI-Light activities.</p>

<h4>Unstructured Play</h4>
<p>Unstructured Play involves a balance of teacher- and child-directed experiences,
where teachers provide materials and a broad theme for exploration. Through
this programme, children develop <strong>appreciation</strong> as they work
collaboratively, learn from one another, and recognise that everyone has
ideas to contribute.</p>
