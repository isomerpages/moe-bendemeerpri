<p>Through a spectrum of teacher-guided, teacher-child shared and child-initiated
learning, MK@Bendemeer fosters learning dispositions from the NEL framework: <strong>Perseverance, Reflectiveness, Appreciation, Inventiveness, a Sense of Wonder, and Engagement. </strong>Outdoor
learning plays an important role in our curriculum as it nurtures children
into confident leaders, passionate learners and members of a gracious community.</p>
<h4>Playground &amp; Wheeled Vehicles Time</h4>
<p>Our Playground and Wheeled Vehicles time focuses on nurturing the disposition
of <strong>Engagement</strong>, where children are deeply interested and
actively involved in learning as they interact with the materials. During
this time, they enjoy learning and playing alongside their friends in a
joyful and meaningful way.</p>
