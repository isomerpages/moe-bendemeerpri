### Welcome to MK@Bendemeer

MOE Kindergarten @ Bendemeer has commenced operation in January 2023 with our first batch of K1 children.&nbsp;

  
At MOE Kindergarten, we believe that children are curious, active, and competent learners. We nurture children holistically so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy. The teaching and learning philosophy of our MK Educators are guided by the Vision Mission and Values of MOE Kindergarten.

### The MK Logo


<img style="width: 60%" src="/images/bendemeer%20colour.jpg">


The colours and the symbol of a kite is inspired by the idea that MK is the wind that enables each child – a coloured kite- to soar to a strong start.&nbsp;


The three colours represent the educators, partners and the curriculum, which are integral to the holistic growth and development of the child. The vibrant colours reflect our beliefs about children –that thtey are active, curious and competent learners.&nbsp;

 
The flying kite in our logo represents our children soaring to greater heights, with the strong foundation they have built in the MOE Kindergartens. The two kite tails symbolize the fun and learning that children will experience in the MOE Kindergarten.
