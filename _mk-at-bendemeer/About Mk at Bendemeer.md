### Welcome to MK@Bendemeer

MOE Kindergarten @ Bendemeer has commenced operation in January 2023 with our first batch of K1 children. 

  
At MOE Kindergarten, we believe that children are curious, active, and competent learners. We nurture children holistically so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy. The teaching and learning philosophy of our MK Educators are guided by the Vision Mission and Values of MOE Kindergarten.

**Purposeful play and quality interactions**

Your child will engage in enjoyable and meaningful activities that promote his or her holistic development.



**Distinctive Singapore flavour**

Your child will engage in relevant and authentic experiences to learn about the people, places and events in Singapore


**Early bilingualism**

Your child will develop listening, speaking and early reading and writing skills in English and one of the 3 official Mother Tongue Languages – Chinese, Malay and Tamil Language.
