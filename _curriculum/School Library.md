#### _<u> Programmes </u>_

##### 1. Reading Programme
  

Getting students to experience the joy of reading is a regular part of the school’s curriculum.  
  

Two periods (one for English, one for Mother Tongue) are set aside each week for our reading programme. Students enjoy a range of activities during these periods. These include engaging read alouds, storytelling and book recommendations. In alternative weeks, students are brought to the library to borrow books.

Storytelling is brought to life with the use of puppets, pop-up books and Kamishibai (i.e., story cards). Students are given opportunities to do book talks and share their reads with their classmates too.

Through reading circles, students have opportunities to engage in rich discussions about their reads with their peers as well. With the use of critical literacy books, students are also encouraged to think critically about what they read. In addition, students also learn more about current affairs by reading and viewing newspapers. Students’ complete reflections in the I Love Reading booklets.

  

##### 2. Assembly Programmes

Students enjoy various reading assembly programmes aimed at nurturing a love of reading in them. These include Book Buzzes (held in collaboration with the National Library Board (NLB)) and book talks by local authors. Videos of staff recommending books are broadcasted during pre-assembly as well.

##### 3. Come as a Book Character Day

Students and teachers had fun dressing up as book characters during the Come as a Book Character Day!

Students shared about the characters they have dressed up as and introduced various interesting books to their classmates during Book Talk. Reading was infused across various subjects throughout that week too – for instance, students read engaging Math stories and Young Scientists magazines in their Math and Science lessons. It was carried out during Mother Tongue lessons as well.
