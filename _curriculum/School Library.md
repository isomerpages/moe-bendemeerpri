### SCHOOL LIBRARY

Our school library committee aims to promote and cultivate a positive disposition towards books and support students in their learning. Our activities aim to help students develop a lifelong habit of reading for enjoyment. We aim to continue our efforts to enthuse and nurture a love of reading in all our students.

We seek to achieve this by

1) conducting reading **programmes** and

2) providing inviting and conducive **spaces / resources** for students to read, collaborate and learn.

**_Programmes_**

**1.** **Reading Programme**  
  

Getting students to experience the joy of reading is a regular part of the school’s curriculum.  
  

Two periods (one for English, one for Mother Tongue) are set aside each week for our reading programme. Students enjoy a range of activities during these periods. These include engaging read alouds, storytelling and book recommendations. In alternative weeks, students are brought to the library to borrow books.

Through reading circles, students have opportunities to engage in rich discussions about their reads with their peers as well. With the use of critical literacy books, students are also encouraged to think critically about what they read. In addition, students also learn more about current affairs by reading and viewing newspapers. Students’ complete reflections in the I Love Reading booklets.

Students and teachers had fun dressing up as book characters during the Come as a Book Character Day!

Students shared about the characters they have dressed up as and introduced various interesting books to their classmates during Book Talk. Reading was infused across various subjects throughout that week too – for instance, students read engaging Math stories and Young Scientists magazines in their Math and Science lessons. It was carried out during Mother Tongue lessons as well.

### 2) Thinkers’ Space – a cosy space for reading

### 3) Reading Nook – a cosy space for younger learners to read

### 4) Digital Corner – digital learning devices available for learners to explore e-books, audio books and the Internet

###
