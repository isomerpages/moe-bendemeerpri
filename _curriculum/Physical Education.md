<h4>House System</h4>
<p>All our school’s staff and students are assigned to 4 different Houses,
namely Rhino (Red), Manta (Blue), Cheetah (Yellow) and Eagles (Green).
The theme of animals was chosen as everyone can easily relate to them and
these 4 chosen animals have very strong and distinct qualities.</p>
<p><strong>Red Rhino</strong>

<h4>Annual Games Day</h4>
<p>In line with the upcoming Paris Olympics 2024, our school will be having
our Annual Games Day at Serangoon Stadium on 22 March 2024, whereby the
Primary 3 to Primary 6 students will get to participate in track and field
events at the stadium.</p>
<p>Students will be grouped according to their Houses: Rhino (red), Manta
(blue), Cheetah (yellow) and Eagles (green) to compete in sprinting, hurdling,
jumping, throwing and relay events to earn points for their respective
Houses and medals for themselves. These House points will be tabulated
to determine the Overall House Champion at the end of the year.</p>
<p>We hope to expose our students with a different sporting experience at
the stadium which allows them a glimpse of how Olympic Games is like. We
will also like to provide them with a platform to exhibit our ASPIRE school
values and Olympic Values of ‘Striving for Excellence’ to be the best that
they can be, ‘Demonstrating Respect’ towards self and their opponents,
‘Celebrating Friendship’ that brings students from different classes and
background together through this sporting event.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>P5 Cohort Camp</h4>
<p>As one of the key Student Development Experiences (SDEs) by MOE to achieve
our CCE learning outcomes, our school will be conducting our P5 Cohort
Camp from 8 to 10 July 2024 at MOE Jalan Bahtera Adventure Centre.</p>
<p>We hope to equip our students with knowledge, skills and values to explore
and connect with natural and urban environments safely and responsibly.
This 3D2N residential cohort camp will allow students to extend and deepen
their learning beyond the classrooms into real life and also provides adventure
and challenge for students to develop and demonstrate resilience, apply
self-management skills and work with others collaboratively.</p>
