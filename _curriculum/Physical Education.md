##### <u>House System</u>

All our school’s staff and students are assigned to 4 different Houses, namely Rhino (Red), Manta (Blue), Cheetah (Yellow) and Eagles (Green). The theme of animals was chosen as everyone can easily related to them and these 4 animals chosen have very strong and distinct qualities.

##### Programmes

<u>Stepping Up Programme</u> <br>
As part of our school’s programme to develop self-directed learners through Physical Education, all Primary 4, 5 and 6 students are given a step tracker for them to monitor their own activity level in terms of the number of steps they have achieved.
<br>
This serves as a guide for students to take ownership of their own fitness level and strive to achieve targets set in terms of the number of steps to be taken every day.
<br>
Students will also be taught on how to use the heart rate to monitor their own activity level.

<u>Annual Games Day</u> <br>
Our school’s inaugural Annual Games Day will be returning on 10 March 2023, whereby all the Primary 3 to Primary 6 students will get to compete in games events and class challenges to vie for the Annual Games Day House Champion 2023.

On that day, students will be grouped according to their Houses: Rhino, Manta, Cheetah and Eagles and compete in Track and Field, Captain’s Ball, Volleyball and Basketball games to earn points for their Houses and medals for themselves. Students will also have a chance in compete in class challenges where every student will be able to put in their best effort to complete tasks assigned to them.

Through the sporting experiences, students will also be able to exhibit ASPIRE school values and teamwork as they compete in a fair and respectful manner.
