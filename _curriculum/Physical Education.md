##### <u>House System</u>

All our school’s staff and students are assigned to 4 different Houses, namely Rhino (Red), Manta (Blue), Cheetah (Yellow) and Eagles (Green). The theme of animals was chosen as everyone can easily related to them and these 4 animals chosen have very strong and distinct qualities.

##### Programmes

<u>Stepping Up Programme</u> <br>
As part of our school’s programme to develop self-directed learners through Physical Education, all Primary 5 students are given a step tracker for them to monitor their own activity level in terms of the number of steps they have achieved. <br>
This serves as a guide for students to take ownership of their own fitness level and strive to achieve targets set in terms of the number of steps to be taken every day. <br>
Students will also be taught on how to use the heart rate to monitor their own activity level.

The P5 students will be doing activities like low elements, Backswoodman cooking, camp craft and a walk to Labrador Park, whereby they can learn more about the floral and fauna and also check out the remnants of what used to be a British military battlement relating to National Education.
