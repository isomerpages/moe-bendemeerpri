<h4>House System</h4>
<p>All our school’s staff and students are assigned to 4 different Houses,
namely Rhino (Red), Manta (Blue), Cheetah (Yellow) and Eagles (Green).
The theme of animals was chosen as everyone can easily relate to them and
these 4 chosen animals have very strong and distinct qualities.</p>
<p><strong>Red Rhino</strong>

<h4>Annual Games Day</h4>
<p>With the theme, ‘<em>Compete with Joy, Connect with Empathy’</em>, our
Annual Games Day this year was conducted on 21 February 2025. The Annual
Games Day provides opportunities for students from Primary 3 to 6 and staff
to come together to compete passionately in the spirit of the activities
and games.</p>
<p>It is also a platform to inculcate in students, the ASPIRE values and
demonstrate these values through the different activities throughout the
event. With the ASPIRE values &amp; the EXPLORE Framework as the foundation,
students work towards achieving personal success.</p>
<p>It was heartening to see everyone coming together to put up their House
decor in the school hall and cheering proudly during the cheer competition.</p>
<p>Cheetah House emerged as the House Champion for Annual Games Day this
year. Congratulations!</p>

<h4>Primary 5 Outdoor Adventure Camp 2025</h4>
<p>From 7 to 9 July 2025, our Primary 5 students experienced three days of
adventure, challenge, and discovery at the MOE Jalan Bahtera Outdoor Adventure
Learning Centre (OALC). This Cohort Outdoor Adventure Camp is one of the
key Student Development Experiences (SDEs) and supports the learning outcomes
of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE).</p>
<p>The camp provided meaningful opportunities for students to explore the
outdoors and develop important life skills. Through activities such as
high elements, outdoor cooking, shelter-building, orienteering, and communal
living, students learnt to manage themselves, work as a team, and step
outside of their comfort zones. These hands-on experiences allowed them
to put our school’s ASPIRE values into practice.</p>
<p>One of the most memorable moments of the camp was the campfire night.
It began with the lighting of the campfire to cheers from the crowd, setting
the stage for an evening of celebration and connection. Students took turns
performing with their classes, showcasing skits, songs, and cheers they
had practised together. Laughter filled the air during the exciting games,
and many students shared that this was their favourite part of camp. It
was a night where friendships were strengthened, confidence grew, and everyone
felt the joy of coming together as one cohort under the stars.</p>
<p>For many students, this was their first time staying away from home. They
returned with a greater sense of independence, new friendships, and a deeper
confidence in what they are capable of. We are proud of how they embraced
each experience with enthusiasm and heart.</p>
