<h4>Chinese New Year Celebrations</h4>
<p>The Chinese New Year celebrations is one of the festive occasions that
students in Bendemeer Primary School celebrate to raise awareness of the
Chinese culture in multi-racial Singapore. Students were encouraged to
be in their ethnic costumes on the day of celebration. A concert was put
up in the school hall. Besides the much looked-forward to the appearance
of Lion Dancer, the God of Fortune, and the Big Head Dolls, students enjoyed
the Chinese dance, singing performances, games and quiz conducted by the
teachers. An educational package was carried out in the classrooms. Our
students had fun during the classroom handicraft activity and learnt about
the significance of Chinese New Year’s culture and practices.</p>
