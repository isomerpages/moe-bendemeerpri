### CHINESE

#### Vision
**Lifelong learner with passion for the Chinese Language and its culture, rooted in moral values**

#### Chinese New Year Celebrations

The Chinese New Year celebrations is one of the festive occasions that students in Bendemeer Primary School celebrate to raise awareness of the Chinese culture in multi-racial Singapore. Students were encouraged to be in their ethnic costumes on the day of celebration. A concert was put up in the school hall. Besides the much looked-forward to the appearance of Lion Dancer, the God of Fortune, and the Big Head Dolls, students enjoyed the Chinese dance, singing performances, games and quiz conducted by the teachers. An educational package was carried out in the classrooms. Our students had fun during the classroom handicraft activity and learnt about the significance of Chinese New Year’s culture and practices.
