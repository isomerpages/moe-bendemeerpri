<h3>CHINESE</h3>
<p>Our Primary 1 to Primary 6 Chinese Language curriculum aims to hone students’
listening, speaking, reading and writing skills through a repertoire of
teaching strategies and ICT-enabled lessons. We hope to bring about joy
of learning. Therefore, lesson activities are carefully scaffolded to support
and enthuse students to read, write and communicate with confidence.</p>
