<h5><strong>Jejak Budaya (Malay Cultural Trail)</strong></h5>
<p><strong>&nbsp;The Malay Language and Cultural ICT trail started in 2016. The trail received positive feedback. This programme was further enhanced with ICT tools such as iPads to scan QR codes to access quizzes. It was further refined in 2018 with the use of google sites to host additional relevant resources such as videos and pictures to enhance learning. Since then, the trail has become a key programme that the students look forward to every year.</strong>

<h5><strong>Hari Raya Puasa Celebrations</strong></h5>
<p>The much-awaited Hari Raya Puasa celebrations is one of the festive occasions
celebrated in Bendemeer Primary School. The celebrations aim to create
awareness of the festival celebrated by the Muslim community in Singapore.
We had our student-emcees speaking in Malay and English as this is a good
platform to encourage bilingualism amongst our students. It is also an
opportunity to share with the school’s multi-racial community, the significance
of the culture and practices during the celebrations.</p>
