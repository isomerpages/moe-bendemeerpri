<h4><strong>Programmes</strong></h4>
<h5>Reading Programme</h5>
<p>The department promotes and encourages reading at all levels. The Reading
Programme sees the reading periods allocated <strong>to Primary 1 to Primary 5 students </strong>within
the curriculum time. It provides students with a progressive reading structure
that not only develops interest in reading but also sparking creative and
critical thinking through critical questions and post-reading activities.</p>
<p>Through this Reading Programme, the pupils can widen their general knowledge
as well as improve on their vocabulary, understanding of text and sentence
structure. This fosters a sense of responsibility and commitment to reading
by emphasizing the joy and success pupils can obtain from reading proficiently.</p>

levels were exposed to a variety of cultural activities such as playing
the angklung, silat and<strong> </strong>rattan weaving.&nbsp;These&nbsp;activities
provide authentic opportunities for students to use and experience the

<h5><strong>Jejak Budaya (Malay Cultural Trail)</strong></h5>
<p>&nbsp;The Malay Language and Cultural ICT trail started in 2016. The trail
received positive feedback. This programme was further enhanced with ICT
tools such as iPads to scan QR codes to access quizzes. It was further
refined in 2018 with the use of google sites to host additional relevant
resources such as videos and pictures to enhance learning. Since then,
the trail has become a key programme that the students look forward to
every year.</p>

<h5>Hari Raya Puasa Celebrations</h5>
<p>The much-awaited Hari Raya Puasa celebrations is one of the festive occasions
celebrated in Bendemeer Primary School. The celebrations aim to create
awareness of the festival celebrated by the Muslim community in Singapore.
We had our student-emcees speaking in Malay and English as this is a good
platform to encourage bilingualism amongst our students. It is also an
opportunity to share with the school’s multi-racial community, the significance
of the culture and practices during the celebrations.</p>
