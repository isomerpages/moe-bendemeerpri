##### MT Language & Cultural ICT Trail

The Malay Language and Cultural ICT trail started in 2016 as a hard-copied booklet trail activity. It was a pilot program held during MT fortnight. Since the ML students gave positive feedback, this program was continued. In 2017, ICT tools such as iPads were used to scan QR codes to access quizzes. It was further refined in 2018 with the use of google sites to host additional relevant resources such as videos and pictures to enhance learning. At the same time, the other MTL departments went onboard and the language and cultural trail became a MT department project. Since then, this has become our MTL key program that the students look forward every year.

Objectives of the programme: <br>
1\.        To provide students a rich language and cultural experience that complements the ML learning curriculum. <br>
2.        To provide students an engaging outdoor program that creates joy of learning <br>
3.        To leverage on the use of ICT to enhance learning
