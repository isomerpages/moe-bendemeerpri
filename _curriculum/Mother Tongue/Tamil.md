<h4>EdTech and Tamil Language</h4>
<p>BPS TL Department integrates EdTech into Tamil language learning by leveraging
digital platforms such as the Student Learning Space (SLS) to deliver interactive
resources, exercises, and assignments that make lessons more engaging and
personalised. Teachers blend multimedia tools such as videos, audio clips,
and online quizzes into classroom instruction to strengthen listening,
speaking, reading, and writing skills in Tamil. EdTech also supports collaboration
and self-paced learning, enabling students to work together on digital
tasks while progressing according to their own learning needs.</p>

<h4>Tamil Reading Club</h4>
<p>The Tamil Reading Club in BPS provides a supportive and engaging platform
for students to develop a love for reading in the Tamil language while
strengthening their literacy skills. Through guided reading sessions, storytelling,<strong> </strong>drama-based
activities, and exposure to age-appropriate Tamil texts, students are encouraged
to read confidently and meaningfully while expressing ideas creatively.
The club also creates opportunities for discussion and reflection, helping
students improve vocabulary, comprehension, and oral expression. As part
of its partnership with the National Library Board, students participate
in a learning journey to the library, where they are introduced to a wider
range of Tamil books and library resources. In addition, a dedicated microsite
available under the Useful Links section below, supports the programme
by providing access to curated reading materials and e-books, further enriching
students’ reading experiences and nurturing an appreciation for the Tamil
language and heritage beyond the classroom.</p>
