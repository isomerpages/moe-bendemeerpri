<h4>Buddy Reading</h4>
<p>Students who need help in reading will be selected for Buddy Reading Programme.
This is conducted on a weekly basis where students meet their reading buddies
during the last 10 minutes of their recess time to practice reading using
the Reading Booklet designed by the Tamil Language Department. This arrangement
allows students to practice responsibility and empathy leading to improving
each other's Reading skills. This is conducted during recess time on Tuesdays
and Thursdays.</p>

<h4>Deepavali Celebration @ BPS</h4>
<p>Deepavali Celebration @ BPS was conducted by the Tamil Department successfully
in the year 2024 with the theme, "Deepavali Beyond Screens". The theme
focused on setting a limit for screen time and how it can affect the Deepavali
celebration preparations and family bondedness. The objective was to develop
cyber wellness and manage relationships for personal and social well-being
towards Deepavali. Tamil Language Department collaborated with MOE Kindergarten,
Indian Dance CCA, Parent Support Group and Indian Heritage Centre to bring
about an enriching Deepavali experience for our students. Deepavali Celebration
was a great platform for our students to display their talents such as
dancing, acting and hosting.</p>
