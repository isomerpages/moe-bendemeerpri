<h4>Buddy Reading</h4>
<p>Students who need help in reading will be selected for Buddy Reading Programme.
This is conducted on a weekly basis where students meet their reading buddies
during the last 10 minutes of their recess time to practice reading using
the Reading Booklet designed by the Tamil Language Department. This arrangement
allows students to practice responsibility and empathy leading to improving
each other's Reading skills. This is conducted during recess time on Tuesdays
and Thursdays.</p>

<h4>Deepavali Celebration @ BPS</h4>
<p>Deepavali Celebration @ BPS was conducted by the Tamil Department successfully
in the year 2023 with the theme, "Deepavali in Diversity". The theme focused
on Celebrating Deepavali together with other races harmoniously. The objective
was to develop social awareness and manage relationships for personal and
social well-being towards Deepavali and Racial harmony. Tamil Language
Department collaborated with MOE Kindergarten, Wushu CCA, Malay Dance CCA,
Indian Dance CCA, Parent Support Group and Indian Heritage Centre to bring
about an enriching Deepavali experience for our students. Deepavali Celebration
was a great platform for our students to display their talents such as
