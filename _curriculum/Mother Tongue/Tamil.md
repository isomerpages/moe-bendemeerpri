#### Buddy Reading

Students who need help in reading will be selected for Buddy Reading Programme. This is conducted on a weekly basis where students meet their reading buddies during the last 10 minutes of their recess time to practice reading using the Reading Booklet designed by the Tamil Language Department. This arrangement allows students to practice responsibility and empathy leading to improving each other's Reading skills. This is conducted during recess time on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

#### Deepavali Celebration @ BPS

Deepavali Celebration @ BPS was conducted by the Tamil Department successfully in the year 2023 with the theme, "Deepavali in Diversity". The theme focused on Celebrating Deepavali together with other races harmoniously. The objective was to develop social awareness and manage relationships for personal and social well-being towards Deepavali and Racial harmony. Tamil Language Department collaborated with MOE Kindergarten, Wushu CCA, Malay Dance CCA, Indian Dance CCA, Parent Support Group and Indian Heritage Centre to bring about an enriching Deepavali experience for our students. Deepavali Celebration was a great platform for our students to display their talents such as dancing, acting and hosting.
