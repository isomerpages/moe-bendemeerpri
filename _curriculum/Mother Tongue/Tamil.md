#### Reading Mum

To help the upper primary (P4 – P6) pupils who need help in reading will be selected for Reading Mum Programme. This has been conducted on a weekly basis where parent volunteers will come on Tuesdays from 2pm – 3pm helping these pupils in their reading. Currently, this programme is not being carried out due to the Safe Management Measures (SMM). Programme will resume according to the MOE guidelines.

Pupils who need help in reading will be selected for Buddy Reading Programme. This is conducted on a weekly basis where senior student readers will buddy the junior readers to improve their reading skills.

#### <u><em>Deepavali Musical</em></u>

Deepavali Musical was conducted by the Tamil Department successfully in the year 2019. Some of our teachers and students performed for a creative concept explaining the meaning behind Deepavali Festival. Deepavali Musical was a great platform for our students to display their talents such as dancing, acting and hosting.
