<h3>MATHEMATICS</h3>
<p>The school’s Mathematics Programme is guided by the Primary Mathematics
Syllabus (MOE 2021). The syllabus aims to enable all students to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continuous
learning in mathematics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive
skills through a mathematical approach to problem-solving;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>build confidence and foster interest in mathematics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To foster the joy in the learning of Mathematics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To build student capacity for self-directed learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To enhance the quality of students’ learning experiences through innovation
and integration</p>

<h4>3 Key Principles in Mathematics Education</h4>
<p>The department uses 3 key principles and 3 phases of learning to plan,
organise and deliver the lessons, programmes and activities.</p>
<h5>Principle 1</h5>
<p>Teaching is for learning; learning is for understanding; understanding
is for reasoning and applying and, ultimately problem solving.</p>
<h5>Principle 2</h5>
<p>Teaching should build on students' knowledge; take cognizance of students'
interests and experiences and engage them in active and reflective learning.</p>
<h5>Principle 3</h5>
<p>Teaching should connect learning to the real world, harness ICT tools
and emphasise 21st century competencies.</p>

<h4>Core Teaching and Learning</h4>
<p>P1 – 6 mathematics curriculum aims to build strong foundation in mathematical
knowledge, concepts and skills in our students through activity-based lessons,
direct-learning and inquired-based learning.&nbsp; Students are given concrete
experiences to help them develop a sense of numbers, make connections and
become better problem solvers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4><u>Learning Programmes that support diverse learners</u></h4>
<p><u>P1 – P4 Learning Support Programmes (LSM Programme)</u> 
<br>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) is an early intervention effort
for students who need additional support in acquiring basic numeracy skills
when they enter Primary 1. Originally intended for Primary 1 and Primary
2, the support has now been extended to Primary 4.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>P4 – P5 E2K Mathematics Programme (Selected students)</u> 
<br>Math E2K is a Mathematics enrichment programme for upper primary students
who demonstrate interest and ability in Mathematics.&nbsp; It aims to foster
independence in mathematical thinking skills, as well as nurture other
important 21st&nbsp;century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness,
critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills.</p>
