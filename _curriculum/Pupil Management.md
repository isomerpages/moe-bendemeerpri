### PUPIL MANAGEMENT

##### Overview

The Pupil Management Department is committed to cultivating a positive education culture that promotes well-being, resilience, and happiness among our students. We believe that a safe, supportive, and positive learning environment is crucial for students to achieve academic success and personal growth. Our team integrates positive education principles into our counselling and behaviour management practices, emphasizing the importance of character strengths, positive relationships, and mindfulness.

We prioritize the social and emotional development of our students, and our department works tirelessly to ensure that each student feels valued, respected, and supported throughout their journey in BPS.

#### School-based Key Programmes

##### Assembly talks
The department promotes positive school culture and the well-being of our students through regular talks that emphasize positive behaviour, respect, and accountability. We integrate positive education principles into our talks to help students develop essential skills such as mindfulness and positive relationships. Our goal is to provide a safe and inclusive learning environment that supports academic success and personal growth.

    
##### Induction for new students

An induction programme is provided for every new student who comes to our school at any time of the year. The school Administrative Manager, School Counsellor and Form Teacher together with the new student and his/her buddy will be involved in this programme. This programme ensures that every new student feel welcomed to the school and his/her needs are being looked into.

#####  Model class award

The termly model class award program was introduced to recognize and reward classes that demonstrate outstanding behaviour and positive attitude. We believe that this initiative fosters a positive school culture and encourages essential skills such as resilience and teamwork. We encourage all our classes to strive for excellence and promote a supportive learning environment.

##### Bi-annual Police Talk (by Rochor NPC)

On a bi-annual basis, the department partners with the police (Rochor NPC) to conduct talks for our students. These talks aim to promote safety and raise awareness of important issues among our students. The talks cover a range of topics such as road safety, cyber safety, crime prevention and drug abuse. Through these talks, our students learn essential safety skills and gain knowledge that can help them make informed decisions in their daily lives.

Our partnership with the police helps to foster a positive relationship between our students and the police, which is important for promoting safety in our community. The talks also align with our positive education principles, as they help students develop character strengths such as responsibility and awareness.

#### Stop, Think, Do Model

In BPS, we believe in taking a proactive approach to behaviour management that is rooted in positive education principles. That's why we have adopted the Stop Think Do model as a key strategy for promoting positive behaviour among our students.

The Stop Think Do model is a positive behaviour management approach that emphasizes the importance of self-regulation, problem-solving, and responsible decision-making. By teaching our students to stop and think before reacting, we are helping them develop the skills they need to manage their emotions and behaviour in a positive way.

Through the use of the Stop Think Do model, our students are learning to regulate their behaviour, take responsibility for their actions, and make positive choices in challenging situations. In addition to its effectiveness in behaviour management, the Stop Think Do model is also grounded in positive education principles. It promotes a growth mindset, encourages students to take ownership of their learning, and helps to develop their resilience and social-emotional skills.
