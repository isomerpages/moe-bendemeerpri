<h3>ENGLISH</h3>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>The vision of the English Department is to ensure that every Bendemeer
student becomes a confident and competent communicator. To realise this
vision, the department has planned a six-year, progressive programme that
develops a strong language foundation and provides rich, meaningful learning
experiences.</p>
<p>Our mission is to inspire a love for learning through engaging learning
activities and positive role modelling. To achieve this, the English Department
has adopted Strategy-Based Instruction as our core pedagogical approach
and has also incorporated Thinking Routines to deepen students’ meaning-making,
strengthen their reasoning skills, and nurture reflective, independent
learners.</p>

<h4><strong>Programmes</strong><br><br>STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading)</h4>
<p>STELLAR’s vision is for all children to develop a love for reading and
hence the use of interesting and engaging stories in the STELLAR curriculum.
The lower primary STELLAR strategies are the Shared Book Approach (SBA),
the Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA) and Learning Centres.
The strategies at the Upper Primary are Guided Reading, Supported Reading,
KWL and Retelling.</p>

<h5>Reading</h5>
<p>Reading is crucial to a child’s success across all contexts in school.
The school has embarked on the “I Read, You Read, We Read” approach to
reading where teachers positively role model reading. One period in the
weekly timetable is set aside for reading. The objective of the reading
period is to inculcate in students a love of reading. During the reading
period, teachers weave in discussions based on Critical Literacy, and use
newspapers to share about current affairs as well as visit the library
to be immersed in the wonderful world of books. Other reading programmes
include:
<br>
<br><strong>Book Talk: </strong>Primary 1 to Primary 5 Students are encouraged
to write a synopsis of a book read. Then they would stand in front of their
classmates and share what they have written. This also fosters confidence
building and student-student relationship.</p>

<p><strong>Book Stop:&nbsp;</strong>To build a strong reading culture, Book
Stop, which features the school mascot driving a mini-library of books,
is brought to the canteen. By creating a print-rich environment in school,
students are encouraged to read avidly at every opportunity.</p>
<h5>Writing</h5>
<p>A spiral progression of skills is key to systematic teaching and learning
of writing. Building on the principles of the Modified&nbsp;Language Experience
Approach (MLEA)&nbsp;at the Lower Primary, the Writing Process Cycle (WPC)
continues to provide students with guidance&nbsp;in planning, writing and
reviewing their work at the Middle and Upper Primary levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, Bendemeer Otter Times is the school’s annual publication
that&nbsp;showcases good English compositions by our very own budding writers.
In each issue, readers follow Ben, the school mascot, on an adventure to
get inspiration and tips for good writing. In the process, our students
are also inspired to adopt a Growth Mindset, taking concrete steps to improve
their writing.&nbsp;</p>

<h5><strong>A Vibrant English Environment</strong></h5>
<h5><strong><u>Come as a Book Character Day&nbsp;</u></strong></h5>
<p>We celebrated our annual Come as a Book Character Day with the theme,
“Paradise is a library”. Our students and teachers were encouraged to dress
up as a character from a book.</p>
<p>The objectives of Come as a Book Character Day are to develop a lifelong
habit of reading for enjoyment and nurture a love of reading in students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conjunction with Earth Day, students were encouraged to create a costume
using recycled materials. During Art lessons, teachers supported the students
with the crafting of the masks and costumes. Students were also given opportunities
in class to share about the characters they dressed up as.</p>
<p>Reading was infused across various subjects throughout that day. During
the Mother Tongue lessons, students shared about their characters in the
respective Mother Tongue languages. Students heard engaging Math stories
during their Math lessons and Science related activities were conducted
during the lessons.</p>

<h5><strong><u>Superspeaker Programme</u></strong></h5>
<p>The EL Department aims to build a culture of communication and conversation
within the classroom. This is done in order to give students voice and
build their confidence. We believe that by providing platforms for students
to present in class as well as by giving them autonomy in the topics they
would like to talk about, we can build their confidence in speaking to
an audience. Every child will have an opportunity to present to their class
in this programme that aims to nurture and culture of conversation within
the classroom.</p>
