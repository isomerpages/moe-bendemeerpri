<h3>ENGLISH</h3>
<h4>Vision and Mission</h4>
<p>The vision of the English Department is to ensure that every student of
Bendemeer is a confident and competent communicator. In order to realise
this vision, the department has planned a six-year programme to provide
our students with a strong foundation and exposure to rich language. The
mission of the English Department is to inspire the love of learning&nbsp;through
rich learning activities and positive role modelling. The English department
has also embarked on Strategy-based instruction as its key approach to
teaching EL.</p>

<h5>Reading</h5>
<p>Reading is crucial to a child’s success across all contexts in school.
The school has embarked on the “I Read, You Read, We Read” approach to
reading where teachers positively role model reading. One period in the
weekly timetable is set aside for reading. The objective of the reading
period is to inculcate in students a love of reading. During the reading
period, teachers weave in discussions based on Critical Literacy, and use
newspapers to share about current affairs as well as visit the library
to be immersed in the wonderful world of books. Other reading programmes
include:</p>
<p>Book Talk: Primary 1 to Primary 5 Students are encouraged to write a synopsis
of a book read. Then they would stand in front of their classmates and
share what they have written. This also fosters confidence building and
student-student relationship.</p>

<p>Book Stop:&nbsp;To build a strong reading culture, Book Stop, which features

<h5>Writing</h5>
<p>A spiral progression of skills is key to systematic teaching and learning
of writing. Building on the principles of the Modified&nbsp;Language Experience
Approach (MLEA)&nbsp;at the Lower Primary, the Writing Process Cycle (WPC)
continues to provide students with guidance&nbsp;in planning, writing and
reviewing their work at the Middle and Upper Primary levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, Bendemeer Otter Times is the school’s annual publication
that&nbsp;showcases good English compositions by our very own budding writers.
In each issue, readers follow Ben, the school mascot, on an adventure to
get inspiration and tips for good writing. In the process, our students
are also inspired to adopt a Growth Mindset, taking concrete steps to improve
their writing.&nbsp;</p>

<h5><strong>A Vibrant English Environment</strong></h5>
<h5><strong><u>Come as a Book Character Day&nbsp;</u></strong></h5>
<p>We celebrated our annual Come as a Book Character Day on Wednesday, 19
April with the theme, “Paradise is a library”. Our students and teachers
were encouraged to dress up as a character from a book.</p>
<p>The objectives of Come as a Book Character Day are to develop a lifelong
habit of reading for enjoyment and nurture a love of reading in students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conjunction with Earth Day, students were encouraged to create a costume
using recycled materials. During Art lessons, teachers supported the students
with the crafting of the masks and costumes. Students were also given opportunities
in class to share about the characters they dressed up as.</p>
<p>Reading was infused across various subjects throughout that day. During
the Mother Tongue lessons, students shared about their characters in the
respective Mother Tongue languages. Students heard engaging Math stories
during their Math lessons and Science related activities were conducted
during the lessons.</p>

<h5><strong><u>Superspeaker Programme</u></strong></h5>
<p>The EL Department aims to build a culture of communication and conversation
within the classroom. This is done in order to give students voice and
build their confidence. We believe that by providing platforms for students
to present in class as well as by giving them autonomy in the topics they
would like to talk about, we can build their confidence in speaking to
an audience. Every child will have an opportunity to present to their class
in this programme that aims to nurture and culture of conversation within
the classroom.</p>
