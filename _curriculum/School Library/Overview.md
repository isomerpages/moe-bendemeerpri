<h3>SCHOOL LIBRARY</h3>
<p>Our school library committee aims to&nbsp;promote and cultivate a positive
disposition towards books&nbsp;and support students in their learning.&nbsp;Our
activities aim to help students&nbsp;develop a lifelong habit of reading
for enjoyment. We aim to continue our efforts to enthuse and nurture a
love of reading in all our students.</p>
<p>We seek to achieve this by
<br>1) conducting reading&nbsp;<strong>programmes</strong>&nbsp;and
<br>2) providing inviting and conducive&nbsp;<strong>spaces / resources</strong>&nbsp;for
students to read, collaborate and learn.</p>

<h4><em><u>Programmes</u></em></h4>
<h5>1. Reading Programme</h5>
<p>Getting students to experience the joy of reading is a regular part of
the school’s curriculum.</p>
<p>Two periods (one for English, one for Mother Tongue) are set aside each
week for our reading programme. Students enjoy a range of activities during
these periods. These include engaging read alouds, storytelling and book
recommendations. In alternative weeks, students are brought to the library
to borrow books.</p>

<p>Storytelling is brought to life with the use of puppets, pop-up books
and Kamishibai (i.e., story cards). Students are given opportunities to
do book talks and share their reads with their classmates too.</p>

<p>Through reading circles, students have opportunities to engage in rich
discussions about their reads with their peers as well. With the use of
critical literacy books, students are also encouraged to think critically
about what they read. In addition, students also learn more about current
affairs by reading and viewing newspapers. Students’ complete reflections
in the I Love Reading booklets.</p>
<h5>2. Assembly Programmes</h5>
<p>Students enjoy various reading assembly programmes aimed at nurturing
a love of reading in them. These include Book Buzzes (held in collaboration
with the National Library Board (NLB)) and book talks by local authors.
Videos of staff recommending books are broadcasted during pre-assembly
as well.</p>

<p>Students shared about the characters they have dressed up as and introduced
various interesting books to their classmates during Book Talk. Reading
was infused across various subjects throughout that week too – for instance,
students read engaging Math stories and Young Scientists magazines in their
Math and Science lessons. It was carried out during Mother Tongue lessons
as well.</p>

attract students and caters to their evolving needs. Besides shelves that
are stocked with a wide range of books to cater to our students’ interests,
the library has four distinct zones for different purposes:</p>
<p>1) Imagination Room – a Makers’ Space for both staff and students to work
on projects and carry out generative discussions
<br>2) Thinkers’ Space – a cosy space for reading
<br>3) Reading Nook – a cosy space for younger learners to read
<br>4) Digital Corner – digital learning devices available for learners to
explore e-books, audio books and the Internet</p>
<h5><u>Book Stop</u></h5>
<p>The Book Stop was created to bring a snippet of the library to the canteen.
This eye-catching mini library allows students to easily pick up a book
during their recesses/lunch.</p>
