<h3>NATIONAL EDUCATION</h3><h3><strong>Social Studies</strong></h3><p>National Education (NE) was launched in 1997. It aims to provide our students with the knowledge, skills, and values to understand Singapore’s history and unique geo-political context, appreciate our journey to nationhood, cultivate the instincts for survival as a nation, and have confidence in our nation’s future.</p><p>CITIZENSHIP DISPOSITIONS: NE provides opportunities for our students to explore and examine their identity as Singaporeans and arrive at a common set of ideals and values. The following key dispositions for citizenship in Singapore shape the purpose and approach to NE:</p><p><strong>A Sense of Belonging</strong>&nbsp;to develop a deeper understanding of who we are as Singaporeans, and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a nation.</p><p><strong>A Sense of Hope</strong>&nbsp;to have confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.</p><p><strong>A Sense of Reality</strong>&nbsp;to be aware of contemporary realities — including Singapore’s constraints and vulnerabilities — which affect us as a nation amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world.</p><p><strong>A Will to Act</strong>&nbsp;to be active citizens who have a collective resolve and a sense of shared mission towards building a Singapore for all.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Knowing_Myself_Poster.jpg"></div><h4><em><u>Programmes</u></em></h4><h5>The Journey of Bendemeer Primary NE Champs</h5><p>Selected P4 to P6 students&nbsp; begin their journey of being an ‘NE Champ’ of the school. These P4 to P6 students embody good citizenship of the school and of Singapore! As an NE Champ, they will be leaders at the forefront to spread the&nbsp;&nbsp;messages of being a good, caring, concerned citizen in our modern world and society. To achieve this, NE Champs use their presentation skills to interact with others when they support the 4 NE Core Events. NE Champs are the key to the events’ success! In fact, they are champions in more ways than they can think of!</p><h5>NE Champs Training Session and Events</h5><p>During these leadership sessions, NE Champs are informed on the roles and responsibilities of being an NE Champ. They also discuss and reflect on their purpose and how they can contribute to serve the school and community. The NE Champs also undergo specialized training in their areas to learn more about their roles in the student leadership of the school. The NE Champs are trained to engage the other students during recess time and during the NE Core Events. Therefore, they help anchor and spread the NE Messages and exhibit the school values to fellow students and staff. In 2024, some NE Champs had the opportunity to attend the Chingay Parade. This enhanced their roles as student leaders in inculcating NE experiences and knowledge to their peers.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Star_NE_Champs.JPG"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/NE_Champ_training.JPG"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/NE_Champ_activities.JPG"></div><h4>Core Events</h4><p>Annually schools observe 4 NE commemorative days which have been identified as defining moments in Singapore's history.&nbsp; The aim is to entrench these events and the images they evoke in the consciousness of each successive generation.</p><p>The 4 events are: <br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total Defence Day <br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International Friendship Day <br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Racial Harmony Day <br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Day <br></p><p></p><h5><u>International Friendship Day (IFD) 2023 @ BPS</u></h5><p>International cooperation remains key in our complex world. Asia is the world's fastest-growing region, and Singapore continues to facilitate closer economic, political, social, and cultural cooperation within ASEAN and in Asia. By recognising the importance of connectedness between our neighbouring countries, our youth can play an active role in fostering people-to-people ties, and thus celebrate the region's diversity and vibrancy and promote the spirit of friendship and collaboration. In addition, our older students can deepen their understanding of Singapore's realities as a small state and appreciate how we can safeguard our national interest and have much to contribute to efforts at international cooperation. Therefore, celebrating “Singapore in Asia” as the theme for 2023.</p><p>The focus for this year was Indonesia. The commemoration started off with a presentation by our international students on Indonesia and its connectivity to Singapore. The students were introduced to the food, traditions, costumes, and customs of Indonesia. The students had a hands-on experience in making the Bebean (Indonesian) kite using recycled materials with the guidance of the NE Champs and International Students.</p><p>There was also collaboration with the Prefectorial Board in promoting the spirit of friendship amongst the students, Friendship@BPS came about as such. Students wrote messages of friendship to each other.&nbsp;</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School_Activities_NE.JPG"></div><h5><u>Racial Harmony Day (RHD) 2023 @ BPS</u></h5><p>The theme for this year was Multicultural Mosaic. Just like a mosaic, each community in Singapore has its own identity. This overlaps with other cultural diversity in Singapore. In BPS, we focused on the key element of living in harmony with others and not taking peace for granted. The students and staff commemorated Racial Harmony Day in July. Fun-filled activities were carried out in collaboration with the PSG and the Aesthetics Department. The students learnt more about the various musical instruments that each ethnic group plays with some hands-on experience. Students created their own paper lanterns and played with bambaram ( spinning top). The staff and students also came dressed in their colourful ethnic attires to immerse into the celebration of multiculturalism.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/collage_mozaic.JPG"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Racial_Harmony.JPG"></div><h5><u>National Day @ BPS</u></h5><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="height:206px; width:200px" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/NE%20Logo.jpg"></div><p>Singapore's 57th birthday was celebrated as a whole school (face to face) this year. Students and staff were attired in colours of red and white. Spirits were high as we sang the current and yesteryears' songs, led by the Aesthetics teachers. The students also participated in the "Get Active" challenge and exercised as a school.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Nationalday2022.jpg"></div><h5><u>P5 NE Show @ Floating Platform</u></h5><p>The P5 students were fortunate to experience NE Show this year after 2 years of haitus. The vibrant and elaborate 57th birthday celebration of the Nation hyped up our students very much. They were eager and enthusiastic to be part of the fabulous event. Through this experience, they exhibited the school values of passion for the Nation and self-discipline in managing themselves in such a major public event.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/National%20day%201.jpg"></div><p>Students excitedly exploring their fun packs for the show.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Nationalday2.jpg"></div><p>Students having their early bento dinner at the Floating Platform before the show began.
