<h3>NATIONAL EDUCATION</h3>
<h3><strong>Social Studies</strong></h3>
<p>National Education (NE) was launched in 1997. It aims to provide our students
with the knowledge, skills, and values to understand Singapore’s history
and unique geo-political context, appreciate our journey to nationhood,
cultivate the instincts for survival as a nation, and have confidence in
our nation’s future.</p>
<p>CITIZENSHIP DISPOSITIONS: NE provides opportunities for our students to
explore and examine their identity as Singaporeans and arrive at a common
set of ideals and values. The following key dispositions for citizenship
in Singapore shape the purpose and approach to NE:</p>
<p><strong>A Sense of Belonging</strong>&nbsp;to develop a deeper understanding
of who we are as Singaporeans, and a shared understanding of the values
that are important to us as a nation.</p>
<p><strong>A Sense of Hope</strong>&nbsp;to have confidence and optimism
in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.</p>
<p><strong>A Sense of Reality</strong>&nbsp;to be aware of contemporary realities
— including Singapore’s constraints and vulnerabilities — which affect
us as a nation amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world.</p>
<p><strong>A Will to Act</strong>&nbsp;to be active citizens who have a collective
resolve and a sense of shared mission towards building a Singapore for
all.</p>

<h4><u>Programmes</u></h4>
<h5><strong>NE Champs Training Session and events</strong></h5>
<p>Under student leadership, the NE Champions (NE Champs), P4 to P6 students,
begin their journey of being a NE Champ’ from Primary 4. These students
embody good citizenship of the school and of Singapore! As a NE Champ for
3 years, they will be leaders at the forefront to spread the messages of
being a good, caring, concerned citizen in our modern world and society.
To achieve this, NE Champs use their presentation skills to interact with
others when they support the 4 NE Core Events. NE Champs also play their
part in integrating the International Students to Singapore through their
interactions with them during key events. In fact, they are champions in
more ways than they can think of!</p>
<p>During their leadership sessions, NE Champs are informed of their roles
and responsibilities. They also discuss and reflect on their purpose and
how they can contribute to serving the school and community. The NE Champs
also undergo specialized training in their areas to learn more about their
roles in the student leadership of the school. The NE Champs are trained
to engage the other students during recess time and during the NE Core
Events. Therefore, they help anchor and spread the NE Citizenship Dispositions
and exhibit the school values to fellow students and staff.

<h4><strong><u>Core Events</u></strong></h4>
<p>Annually schools observe 4 NE commemorative days which have been identified
as defining moments in Singapore's history.&nbsp; The aim is to entrench
these events and the images they evoke in the consciousness of each successive
generation.</p>
<p>The 4 events are:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total Defence Day
<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; International Friendship Day
<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Racial Harmony Day
<br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; National Day

</div>
<p>Bendemeer Primary School commemorated Total Defence Day (TDD) in February
2025. The theme this year was, “Together We Keep Singapore Strong”. Our
school’s focus was on the following NE Dispositions: A Sense of Belonging,
A Sense of Reality, A Sense of Hope, A Will to Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As crises and disruptions become increasingly common, it is important
for our students to be prepared to respond to the potential disruptions
in their lives. By experiencing simulations of disruptions to Singapore,
students will learn:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>How to respond and help one another calmly and responsibly in such circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The importance for everyone in Singapore to be ready to respond to the
ever-evolving threats and challenges to our nation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How everyone in Singapore can work together and play our part in Total
Defence, to remain a strong, united and resilient people.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Although the focus is on Psychological Defence through this disruption, all the 6 pillars of Total Defence were addressed during this commemoration in class or through school-wide activities. This year, the students experienced Power Disruption (Sense of Reality). They experienced power disruption for 30 minutes.</em>
</p>
<p>Here is a glimpse of the activities we experienced:</p>

<h4><strong><u>International Friendship Day (IFD) 2025 @ BPS</u></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;The theme this year was “Forging friendships in a Complex World.”
The ASEAN country in focus was Malaysia. This is a day dedicated to the
understanding of Singapore's relations with neighbouring countries and
beyond. The commemoration of IFD allowed our students to be sensitised
to Singapore's geopolitical realities, and to reflect on the importance
of&nbsp;the spirit of friendship and collaboration amongst different people.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>The commemoration began with a presentation by our international
students on Malaysia and its connectivity to Singapore. The students were
introduced to the food, traditions, costumes, and customs of Malaysia.
The students were also involved in making friendship bracelets and bookmarks
using recycled materials like plastic and paper. The PSG members guided
the students through these activities. The students also learnt about the
partnerships that our school has with schools from other countries as part
of our partnership collaboration. They learnt that friendship can exists
between friends, schools and even countries. This was a collaboration between
the NE Champs, International Students and PSG.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Racial Harmony Day (RHD) 2025 @ BPS</u></strong></h4>
<p>The theme for this year was “Multicultural Tapestry”. Just like the threads
in a tapestry, each of us are unique cultural threads in Singapore. In
BPS, we focused on the key element of living in harmony with others and
not taking peace for granted. The students and staff commemorated Racial
Harmony Day in July. Fun-filled activities were carried out in collaboration
with our PSG. The students created their own BPS Tapestry where we were
different colours that represented different areas; red represented courage,
pink represented care, blue represented peace/calm, green represented the
environment and purple represented resilience. The colour orange weaved
all these unique colours together to form the tapestry. The students learnt
more about the ‘old school’ snacks and games that Singaporeans used to
play during the Kampong Days. People from different races and religions
bonded through these activities back in those days. This year, the students
also played interactive Racial Harmony games at ASPIRE Arena.</p>

<h4><strong><u>P5 NE Show 2025 @ the Padang (where the first National Day was held)</u></strong></h4>
<p>The Primary 5 students get the opportunity to be a part of the NE Show
yearly. The NE Show took place at the legendary Padang for the third year.
The students were thrilled to be a part of the celebration of the nation
as it was the first for many of them. They did the Kallang Wave, sang the
National Day songs and soaked into the red sea of students, celebrating
the nation’s 60<sup>th</sup> birthday. The special segments of the show
kept the students energized and vibrant.</p>

<h4>P4 and P5 Cohort Learning Journeys</h4>
<p>The Cohort LJs consist of Museum-based Learning (MBL) to the Kreta Ayer
Heritage Gallery (Primary 4), Indian Heritage Centre (Primary 5) and Asian
Civilisation Museum (Primary 6). These LJs provided them with opportunities
to explore their Singapore identity through the arts, culture and heritage.
These LJs complement the Art, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)
and Social Studies (SS) curricula. The students were given the opportunity
to explore space and etiquette in the museum and be engaged in observations
and inquiry into selected heritage artefacts with a focus on the history
of early Singapore. Through discussions and reflections, the students were
able to make connections that developed and reinforced their Character
and Citizenship Education (CCE) outcomes.</p>

<h4>Social Studies Curriculum @ BPS</h4>
<p>The Social Studies curriculum spans the primary and secondary levels.
This subject helps students to grow in knowledge, develop skills and learn
values through examining issues that are of concern to our society and
the world in which we live. At BPS, the students go through different experiences
in achieving the purpose of Social Studies.</p>

</div>
<p>In addition to game-based learning, in BPS, the students learn more about
their environment, the history of the schools that have merged and the
national symbols around the school during their school-based learning journeys.
These customised learning journeys are curated with the key focus in the
Social Studies syllabus. &nbsp;These journeys begin in school for the Primary
1 and Primary 2 through the use of info-technology. The young family members
are introduced to Ben, the school mascot who is an explorer. He begins
his exploration in school and expands to the world through the gigantic
world map that we have in the school.</p>

</div>
<p>To enrich the inquisitive minds of our students further, many collaborative
efforts take place in BPS between subject areas like Social Studies, Library
(reading) and Applied Learning Programme (ALP). The P5 students are also
given opportunities to design their own NE cum Camp T-shirts as a collaboration
with the PE department. These collaborative efforts enable the students
to connect what they learn with the real-life context. &nbsp;</p>

<h4>Integration of International Students @BPS</h4>
<p>The international students have a 3-year programme from P4 to P6 where
they would go for learning journeys to various iconic landmarks in Singapore.
This would be done through a physical learning journey or a virtual learning
journey. The students would learn more about the different races and cultures
through this authentic experiential learning. They also learn about the
history of Singapore. They are also involved in the NE commemorative events
where they collaborate with the NE Champs and carry out activities for
the rest. Rich learning takes place through this process. The P1 to P3
international students learn more about Singapore’s old school games through
the game-based learning in the class.</p>
