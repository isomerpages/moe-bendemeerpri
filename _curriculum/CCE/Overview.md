Our school strongly believes in its mission of nurturing and inspiring students to love learning, lead confidently, and make a difference in the lives of others.  To develop our students to be passionate learners and confident leaders, we provide opportunities for them to develop into responsible individuals and understand their roles in shaping the future of our nation. 

#### Learning Outcomes (LOs) for Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)  

Guided by our school vision, mission and the principles in developing a student-centric, value-driven education, the educational years students spend in our school takes them through their social roles in the various domains of self, family, school, community, nation and the world.  We hope our pupils will exhibit the following behavioural traits at the respective portion of their schooling years.

**1\. ASPIRE Wednesdays**

**Objective**

At Bendemeer Primary School, we strive to develop our students to become persons of good character with sound moral values. As part of values education and to provide an opportunity to strengthen teacher-student relationship, we conduct our department designed ASPIRE sessions every Wednesday mornings. Teachers share and explore contemporary and social issues with the focus of creating teachable moments to inculcate values in our students.

**2.** **Mindfulness Practices - ‘Start Each Day With A Grateful Heart’, Bendemeer Student Pledge and Daily Quiet Time Exercise**

**Objective**

‘Start Each Day with a Grateful Heart’ is a CCE department initiative aimed at developing in our students a sense of gratitude for the things / people in their lives. Being mindful to take stock and appreciate the littlest things in their lives help students to see the positive amidst challenging times. Teachers and students are encouraged to pen down notes in which they indicate what they are grateful for. Also, after recess, students recite the Bendemeer Student Pledge that serves to remind them of their purpose in school, as a member of the school community and are engaged in deep breathing exercises after that to refocus their state of mind to learn as one Bendemeer family.

**3\. Our Everyday Responsibilities**

Bendemeer Primary belongs to all our students. To inculcate a sense of responsibility in keeping their shared environment clean and pleasant, students are involved in various activities at the start and end of each term, such as ‘Groom My Class’ and ‘Use My Hands’ that provide opportunities for students and their form teachers to bond by tidying up their classroom and demonstrating a commitment to this collective effort together. The daily end of day classroom cleaning and canteen cleaning also cultivates a good habit to be disciplined and follow-through in ensuring that the state of their classroom and canteen remains clean after use. While recognising that mistakes can be made, through the Happy Mop programme, students learn to develop the value of Self-Discipline by taking responsibility for the water spilled and taking the initiative to locate the nearest mop to clean up after themselves.

**5\. Enhanced CCE lessons (ECCE) Lower Primary**

As the name suggests, ECCE lessons aim to enhance the character development of our students in our school ASPIRE values and CCE R3ICH values (Responsibility, Respect, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony). ECCE lessons differ from the usual CCE curriculum in that the lessons are conducted by form teachers and this provides opportunity for the form teacher to strengthen teacher-student relation and peer support relations. The lessons are designed and customised to meet the needs of the students and explicitly integrate school values into it.

Activities:

Our Primary 4 CCE (EL) students were appointed as P4 star ambassadors (SUSTAINING TOILETS AS RESTROOMS (STAR) and scheduled on a duty roster to carry out daily inspections of the washrooms. Students were briefed and educated by their CCE teacher on the learning objectives of the programme and their roles and responsibilities as star ambassadors. At the end of the programme, our students were educated

(1) on the positive and negative impact their actions have in building a quality restroom culture,
