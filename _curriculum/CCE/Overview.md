<h4>Character Development @ Bendemeer Primary School</h4>
<p>Our school strongly believes in its mission of nurturing and inspiring
students to love learning, lead confidently, and make a difference in the
lives of others.&nbsp; To develop our students to be passionate learners
and confident leaders, we provide opportunities for them to develop into
responsible individuals and understand their roles in shaping the future
of our nation.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Learning Outcomes (LOs) for Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</h4>
<p>Guided by our school vision, mission and the principles in developing
a student-centric, value-driven education, the educational years students
spend in our school takes them through their social roles in the various

<h4><u>1. ASPIRE Wednesdays</u></h4>
<h5>Objective</h5>
<p>At Bendemeer Primary School, we strive to develop our students to become
persons of good character with sound moral values. As part of values education
and to provide an opportunity to strengthen teacher-student relationship,
we conduct our department designed ASPIRE sessions every Wednesday mornings.
Teachers share and explore contemporary and social issues with the focus
of creating teachable moments to inculcate values in our students.</p>
<h4><u>2. Mindfulness Practices - ‘Start Each Day With A Grateful Heart’, Bendemeer Student Pledge and Daily Quiet Time Exercise and 'Thankful Thursdays'.</u></h4>
<h5>Objective</h5>
<p>Aimed to develop in our students a sense of gratitude in their lives and
equip them with the competency to stay positive amidst challenging times,
students seek to start each day with a grateful heart and be mindful to
take stock and appreciate the littlest things in their lives. Teachers
and students are encouraged to pen down notes in which they indicate what
they are grateful for. 'Thankful Thursdays' mornings are alternated with
grateful exercise and bucket filling exercise. In the former, our Peer
Support Leaders share gratitude notes from their peers to lead the school
in a moment of gratitude. In the latter, students who have been caught
filling their teachers' buckets by doing the right things are affirmed
and recognised for their efforts.</p>

<p></p>
<p>After every recess, students recite the Bendemeer Student Pledge that
serves to remind them of their purpose as a student, as a member of the
school committee and are engaged in deep breathing exercises after that
to refocus their state of mind to respect one another and to learn as one
Bendemeer Family.</p>
<h4><u>3. Our Everyday Responsibilities</u></h4>
<p>Bendemeer Primary belongs to all our students. To inculcate a sense of
responsibility in keeping their shared environment clean and pleasant,
students are involved in various activities at the start and end of each
term, such as ‘Groom My Class’ and ‘Use My Hands’ that provide opportunities
for students and their form teachers to bond by tidying up their classroom
and demonstrating a commitment to this collective effort together. The
daily end of day classroom cleaning and canteen cleaning also cultivates
a good habit to be disciplined and follow-through in ensuring that the
state of their classroom and canteen remains clean after use. While recognising
that mistakes can be made, through the Happy Mop programme, students learn
to develop the value of Self-Discipline&nbsp;by taking&nbsp;responsibility
for the water spilled and taking the initiative to locate the nearest mop
to clean up after themselves.</p>

<h4><u>5. Enhanced CCE lessons (ECCE) Lower Primary</u></h4>
<p>As the name suggests, ECCE lessons aim to enhance the character development
of our students in our school ASPIRE values and CCE R3ICH values (Responsibility,
Respect, Resilience, Integrity, Care and Harmony). ECCE lessons differ
from the usual CCE curriculum in that the lessons are conducted by form
teachers and this provides opportunity for the form teacher to strengthen
teacher-student relation and peer support relations. The lessons are designed
and customised to meet the needs of the students and explicitly integrate
school values into it to communicate to students the expected observables.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><u>6. Education and Career Guidance (ECG)</u></h4>
<p>As part of our Education and Career Guidance (ECG) efforts, our upper
primary students actively engaged with the <em>MySkillsFuture</em> portal
— a dynamic platform designed to help them discover their interests, strengths,
and aspirations. The portal also introduced students to Career Quest, enabling
them to explore various industries and professions in a fun and engaging
way. Through interactive features such as avatar creation and career exploration
tools, students gained valuable insights into their personal profiles and
future possibilities.</p>
<p>These sessions play a crucial role in nurturing a sense of purpose by
helping students understand the skills, attitudes, and knowledge needed
to achieve their goals. With greater awareness of the Singapore education
landscape and career opportunities, students are empowered to make informed,
responsible decisions about their future learning and career pathways.</p>
<p>By the end of the sessions, students expressed greater confidence in navigating
the platform independently to further explore their options and set meaningful
goals.</p>
