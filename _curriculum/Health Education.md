<h3>HEALTH EDUCATION</h3>
<p>The school aims to promote holistic wellness in pupils and the staff of
Bendemeer Primary School by inculcating good health habits. They are encouraged
to make the right choices to lead a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<h4>Programmes</h4>
<h5><strong>1. &nbsp;Healthy Meals in Schools Programme</strong></h5>
<p>In 2016, our school started adopting the Healthy Meals in Schools Programme.
This programme provides food service guidelines for the school canteen
and aims to cultivate good eating habits amongst our pupils and our staff,
so that they will be accustomed to consume fruit, vegetables and whole
grains as part of their daily diet. The school works together with the
stall vendors to ensure that nutritious foods are sold. The stall vendors
sell set meals which include a fruit serving. The school also ensures that
all food items and ingredients used carry the Healthier Choice Symbol.
&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>2. Healthy Refreshments for Staff</strong></h5>
<p>In collaboration with the Staff Welfare Committee, fruits and/or healthier
snack options are provided for the staff for all staff bonding activities.</p>
<h5><strong>3. &nbsp;School Dental Programme</strong></h5>
<p>Every year, the school Dental staff will conduct a dental health talk
for the Primary 1 pupils. They will learn more about the prevention of
tooth decay. They will also learn proper ways of brushing their teeth.</p>
<p>The school dental staff will also share on the prevention of dental plague
when the pupils go for their dental treatment. They will also learn how
to use the disclosing toothpaste and how to brush properly and effectively.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>A dental health talk will also be conducted for all P5 pupils. The talk
will allow pupils to learn more about gum diseases and oral care.</p>
