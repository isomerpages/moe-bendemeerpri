<p>Bendemeer Primary School follows the Science Curriculum Framework that
guides all schools in the design and enactment of the school-based science
curriculum.</p>
<p>The science department constantly strives to develop our students to be
scientifically literate, so that they can make informed decisions and take
responsible actions in their daily lives. Through the school’s inquiry-based
science curriculum thar focuses on strong science fundamentals: Core Ideas
of Science, Practices of Science and the Values, Ethics &amp; Attitudes
in Science, students have opportunities to be INspired by science, INquire
like scientists and INnovate using science. The three INs can be achieved
with teachers and partners facilitating students in their learning processes.</p>
<p>In Bendemeer Primary School, the science curriculum is planned based on
the three aspects shown below (content, pedagogy and assessment), with
each aspect linked to the others in a two-way manner.</p>

<h5>Pedagogical Approach</h5>

</div>
<p>In delivering the science curriculum, the department leverages on the
pedagogy of “Science Play, Science Talk”. As shown above, this pedagogical
approach is founded on the five elements of Science as Inquiry, highlighted
in the Science Curriculum Framework.</p>
<h5>Programmes</h5>
<p>By adopting student–centric approach in our curriculum, pedagogy and assessment,
the department strives to develop in our students the 21st&nbsp;Century
competencies. Through the various programmes and activities planned by
the department, students are presented with opportunities to use ICT tools
as they collaborate and exhibit critical and analytical thinking skills.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, the Science E2K programme engages students in scientific
investigations as they seek to solve problems presented to them through
the assigned tasks. It aims to foster scientific inquiry in students and
help them develop science process skills. The programme also promotes key
21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical
and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Science department also constantly look out for opportunities
to enrich students’ learning in authentic settings. This included the hydroponics
programme, through which the P3 students learnt a sustainable way to grow
vegetables in a land-scarce country like Singapore.</p>

<p>The department also infused Environment Education elements into the Science
curriculum with the aim of deepening conceptual understanding and promoting
environmental stewardship by the students. With the easing of the safe
management measures, the P6 participated in the Sungei Buloh learning journey
at the end of Term 2. Through the learning journey, the students learnt
the need to conserve mangroves, and the different forms of plant and animal
adaptation in the mangrove community, among other learning objectives.</p>

<h5>Resources</h5>
<p>The school has two science laboratories that are fully equipped with apparatus
and resources to facilitate the teaching and learning of Science. Science
practical lessons are conducted in the two laboratories.&nbsp;To allow
students to learn beyond the walls of the classroom, our school has&nbsp;a
Science Garden and Science pond so that outdoor lessons can be planned
for the students.</p>
