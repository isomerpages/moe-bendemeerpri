<p>Through the Aesthetics domain, every student is given the opportunities
to appreciate the Arts, to nurture their talents and inspire their peers.
With curious minds, the students explore and experiment with the different
Arts forms. They learn to appreciate the&nbsp;local, ASEAN and international
music and performing arts genres. The students continue to develop their
passion for the Arts with a spirit of excellence. Apart from the skills
and knowledge acquisition, the Aesthetics domain provide them with a platform
to build their confidence, hone their 21st&nbsp;century competencies and
strengthen the inculcation of school values.</p>

<h4><strong>Bendemeer’s Got Talent</strong></h4>
<p>Bendemeer’s Got Talent is a platform that encourages students to continue
to pursue further their passion in the Aesthetics. Through video submission
via SLS, selected students are given the opportunities to showcase their
talents for school events such as National Day and Teacher’s Day. Through
this opportunity, students can boost their confidence and take ownership
of their learning through the performances.</p>

to theirs and their peers’ well-being.</p>
