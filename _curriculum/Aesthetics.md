| **Motto** | To Appreciate the Arts, <br> To Nurture Talents, <br> To Inspire Others |
| **Vision** | Creative and passionate learners with a spirit of excellence in the Arts. |
| **Mission** | To instil confidence and nurture curious minds with a deeper appreciation for the Arts. |


Through the Aesthetics domain, every student is given the opportunities to appreciate the Arts, to nurture their talents and inspire their peers. With curious minds, the students explore and experiment with the different Arts forms. They learn to appreciate the&nbsp;local, ASEAN and international music and performing arts genres. The students continue to develop their passion for the Arts with a spirit of excellence. Apart from the skills and knowledge acquisition, the Aesthetics domain provide them with a platform to build their confidence, hone their 21st&nbsp;century competencies and strengthen the inculcation of school values.

#### **Bendemeer’s Got Talent**

Bendemeer’s Got Talent is a platform that encourages students to continue to pursue further their passion in the Aesthetics. Through video submission via SLS, selected students are given the opportunities to showcase their talents for school events such as National Day and Teacher’s Day. Through this opportunity, students are able to boost their confidence and take ownership of their learning through the performances.

#### Recess Performances and Activities

Recess is another platform for our students to express their creativity. We have performances and doodle drawing at the Aesthetics wall. Our students truly enjoy themselves and learn to practise the school’s values of passion and empathy as they promote their love for learning and contribute positively to theirs and their peers’ well-being.
