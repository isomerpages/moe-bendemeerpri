The Overall CCA Programme in the school consists of Modular CCA and Niche CCA.

Modular CCA is introduced for all students.  In alignment to PERI recommendation of the Programme for Active Learning (PAL) for lower Primary, PAL will be subsumed as part of the Modular CCA for Primary 1 and Primary 2 (total 2 hours a week).  For Primary 3 to Primary 6 students, Modular CCA aims to encourage mass participation in sports enrichment, visual and performing arts enrichment, ICT programming and life skills programmes (total 1.5 hours a week).

There are 3 different types of Niche CCAs, namely Sports and Games, Performing Arts and Clubs. For Sports and Games Niche CCAs, our school offers Floorball, Rope-Skipping, Sepak Takraw, Track and Field and Wushu. For Performing Arts Niche CCAs, our school offers Concert Band, Chinese, Malay and Indian Dances.  For Niche Clubs, our school offers Art and Environment Clubs.

Niche CCAs is for selected students who have been selected to take part to these CCAs and they will be trained for both internal and external competitions and performances.  Depending on the training schedules, these Niche CCAs may be conducted during Modular CCA timing and/or outside curricular hours.  Students will receive a Niche CCA Option Form upon their selection for the Niche CCAs and consent forms to inform parents of the training schedules and activities if the training is done outside curricular hours.
