<p>Every sepak takraw training sessions are conducted before and during the
national competitions. Post-competition, current and new potential sepak
takraw players will continually be scouted and identified to attend further
training in preparation for next year’s competition.</p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Sepak takraw differs from the similar sport of volleyball in its use of
a rattan ball and only allowing players to use their feet, knee, chest
and head to touch the ball. It is a popular sport in South-East Asia. In
Malaysia, the game is called sepak raga or takraw.
<br>
<br>A match is played between two teams, also known as ‘regus’, each consisting
of three players. One of the three players shall be at the back; he is
called a “tekong”. The other two players shall be in front, one on the
left and the other on the right. The player on the left is called a ‘left
inside’ and the player on the right is called the ‘right inside’. The side
that must serve first shall start the first set. The side that wins the
first set shall have the options of ‘choosing service’. The throw must
be executed as soon as the referee calls the score. If either of the “inside’
players throws the ball before the referee calls the score, it must be
re-thrown and a warning will be given to the thrower.
<br>
<br>During the service, as soon as the Tekong kicks the ball, all the players
are allowed to move freely in their respective courts. The service is valid
if the ball passes over the net, whether it touches the net or not, and
inside the boundary of the two net tapes and boundary lines of the opponent’s
court.</p>
<h4><u>Techniques and skills in sepak takraw</u></h4>
<p>Often involving agility, flexibility, and strength, sepak takraw is a
sport that combines many different kicks, spikes, and serves. These range
from basic ones that most beginners would be able to pick up easily, to
the more acrobatic kinds that require long periods of training and practice
to execute flawlessly.</p>
<h5>Inside kick</h5>
<p>Regarded as the most common and basic kick in sepak takraw, the inside
kick is used for controlling the ball. This is done with the inside of
the foot, as its name implies. Stand with your feet apart, and bend your
supporting leg a little. Hit the ball with the inside of your other foot.</p>
<h5>Outside kick</h5>
<p>Not very commonly used, the outside kick is a defensive kick that propels
the ball upwards. To execute an outside kick, the outside of your foot
must make contact with the ball as your knee bends inwards. The entire
kicking leg should make a right angle at the knee, with the calf and foot
pointing outwards.</p>
<h5>Knee kick</h5>
<p>The knee kick actually utilises the thigh - the ball is hit with the part
of the thigh that is just above your knee. The stance is reminiscent of
marching, but your knees would have to be raised as high as possible. This
kick is usually done by players receiving a serve.</p>
<h5>Header</h5>
<p>Not unlike a football header, a header spike in sepak takraw involves
the use of the forehead to make the ball fly, especially when it’s too
high in the air for your kick to reach it. This technique is used for both
serving and striking.</p>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<p>Since 2006, some of the pupils were identified as potential sepak takraw
players and hence a team was formed to participate in the zonal competition.</p>
<p>Since then, our sepak takraw boys have performed well in the zonal and
subsequently went on to qualify and performed well in the National competition.</p>
<p>To provide quality competition experiences for our school athletes to
support character development through the pursuit of sporting excellence.</p>
