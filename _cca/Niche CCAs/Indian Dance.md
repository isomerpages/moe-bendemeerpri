<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The Indian Dance Club was formed in 2007 with a small group of P2 pupils.
Currently we have a total of&nbsp;30 pupils from P3-P6. Indian dance club
is a platform for pupils to showcase their capabilities and&nbsp;strengths
in the performing arts such as dance. Pupils are exposed to National Competitions
such as the&nbsp;Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) every two years. They are
also given the opportunity to perform in school&nbsp;events and programmes
organized by external organizations. Indian Dance pupils undergo basic
dance&nbsp;steps training during the first month. Sectional training is
conducted by the teachers-in-charge for some&nbsp;pupils who require more
guidance in acquiring the dance skills. Pupils learn contemporary, classical
and&nbsp;Bollywood styles of Indian dance to gain greater exposure.</p>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To promote the passion for Indian dance among pupils and provide opportunities
to expose and develop&nbsp;their talent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop pupils’ social emotional learning (SEL) through their weekly
learning process and team&nbsp;work. Pupils who demonstrate positive SEL
will be awarded with ‘Indian Dance Values Award’&nbsp;certificate every
term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop pupils’ reflective skills by penning down their learning points
and feelings on their Indian&nbsp;Dance Journal book.</p>
