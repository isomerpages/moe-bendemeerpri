#### Introduction

The Indian Dance Club was formed in 2007 with a small group of P2 pupils. Currently we have a total of 30 pupils from P3-P6. Indian dance club is a platform for pupils to showcase their capabilities and strengths in the performing arts such as dance. Pupils are exposed to National Competitions such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) every two years. They are also given the opportunity to perform in school events and programmes organized by external organizations. Indian Dance pupils undergo basic dance steps training during the first month. Sectional training is conducted by the teachers-in-charge for some pupils who require more guidance in acquiring the dance skills. Pupils learn contemporary, classical and Bollywood styles of Indian dance to gain greater exposure. 

#### Objectives

*   To promote the passion for Indian dance among pupils and provide opportunities to expose and develop their talent. 
*   To develop pupils’ social emotional learning (SEL) through their weekly learning process and team work. Pupils who demonstrate positive SEL will be awarded with ‘Indian Dance Values Award’ certificate every term. 
*   To develop pupils’ reflective skills by penning down their learning points and feelings on their Indian Dance Journal book. 

#### Achievements

*   2018 SYF Arts Presentation  - Certificate of Distinction
