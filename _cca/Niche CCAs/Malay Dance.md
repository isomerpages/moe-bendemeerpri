#### Introduction

Our Malay Dnace Niche CCA is under the baton of Mr Muhammad Nur Haziq. He has been with us since 2022. 

Pupils will learn and master the five basic steps of Asli, Inang, Masri, Zapin and Joget. Upon this learning outcome, it will enable the pupils to flourish further into dancing gracefully with choreography.

With our teachers’ guidance, the pupils are able to learn the traditions, culture and language thus, moulding them to be an active leader and taking charge of the responsibilities given to them.
