<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Rope skipping is a sport where one or more participants jump over a swung
rope so that it passes under their feet and over their heads. There are
many types of rope skipping events such as speed events and freestyle events.
The events are often separated by gender and age.</p>
<p>In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope going around
the jumper every time one of their feet hit the ground for 30 seconds,
one minute, or three minutes. The jumper is judged on the number of times
the right foot touches the ground in those times.</p>
<p>In freestyle events, jumpers use a variety of basic and advanced techniques
in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges,
and performance judges. Different techniques can be used when skipping
and these can be used individually, or combined in a series, to create
a routine.</p>
<p>Rope skipping is a high intensity level workout, like jogging or bicycle
riding. Skipping for 15–20 minutes is enough to burn off the calories from
a candy bar and is equivalent to 45–60 minutes of running (depending on
the intensity of jumps and leg swings.) Many professional trainers, fitness
experts and MMA fighters greatly recommend skipping for burning fat over
any other alternative exercises like running and jogging.</p>
