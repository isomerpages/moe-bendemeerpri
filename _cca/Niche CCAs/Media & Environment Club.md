<p>The Media and Environment Club is in line with the school’s&nbsp;Applied
Learning Programme (ALP) with the focus on Environmental Sustainability.</p>
<p>We aim to nurture an appreciation for the environment and develop social
responsibility towards the environment among our students.</p>
<p>Our CCA members are the ambassadors who lead their school mates towards
a more sustainable future by caring for our environment. This will be achieved
through the main thrusts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Conducting school-wide programmes to raise awareness on environment issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting the recycling culture among students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working and collaborating with stakeholders on environment programmes.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Earth Day 2026 <br></h4>
<p>In 2026, our school will be celebrating two important environmental events,
World Water Day and Earth Day. It is to remind us of our shared responsibility
to care for the planet.</p>
<p>World Water Day, which will be observed on 30 March with the theme “Make
Every Drop Count,” will highlight how precious water is and remind us that
some communities around the world face difficulties in accessing clean
and fresh water.</p>
<p>Earth Day, which will be celebrated on 22 April with the theme “Our Power,
Our Planet,” will emphasise the power of our daily choices in protecting
the Earth.</p>
<p>Through these events, we will learn how conserving water, reducing waste,
and practising sustainable habits can make a positive difference.</p>

<p>In celebration of Earth Day, our school came together under the theme <em>Our Power, Our Planet</em> to
raise awareness about the importance of renewable energy and caring for
our environment. The Media and Environment Club kick-started the day with
an engaging school presentation, educating students on various types of
renewable energy and how they contribute to a more sustainable future.</p>

<p>During recess, students were treated to a fun and interactive puzzle-matching
game designed by members of the Media and Environment Clubs. The puzzles
were creatively made from recycled cereal boxes, reinforcing the message
of reusing materials to reduce waste.</p>

<p>In addition, an informative display board showcased how countries such
as Singapore, Canada, Japan, Sweden, and New Zealand are adopting renewable
energy practices. Through these visuals, students learned how global communities
are working towards a greener future and how they, too, can play a part.</p>

<p>It was a meaningful and educational event that reminded everyone that
protecting the planet starts with us.</p>
<h4>World Water Day 2025 - Glacier Preservation</h4>

</div>
<p>In support of the worldwide <em>World Water Day</em> movement, our school
focused this year’s theme on <em>Save Our Glaciers</em>. The Media and Environment
Clubs took the lead by researching glaciers across different continents
and exploring how global warming has caused them to shrink at an alarming
rate.</p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p>Through their presentation, the students shared how the melting of glaciers
not only threatens ecosystems but also affects human populations that rely
on glaciers for freshwater and stable climates. Their well-researched findings
were presented to the whole school, raising awareness about the urgent
need to protect these vital water sources.</p>
<p>The event reminded everyone that conserving water and fighting climate
change are global responsibilities—and it starts with being informed and
taking small actions in our daily lives.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In November 2025, our Environment Club members went on an exciting learning
journey to the City Developments Limited (CDL) EcoTrain. We embarked on
a fun and interactive digital journey to learn more about Singapore’s lush
forests, diverse wildlife, and conservation efforts.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/env_2026_1.png">
</div>
<p>Through engaging displays and hands-on exhibits, students discovered how
nature and sustainability are connected to our daily lives. At the end
of the visit, students also wrote down their personal commitments to protect
and save the environment, showing their promise to care for our planet
through everyday actions.</p>

<h4>Co+Nut+Ink Learning Journey</h4>
<p>In May 2025, our Environmental Club members had an enriching learning
journey to Co+Nut+Ink on May, where they discovered how the company contributes
to sustainability and environmental stewardship. The visit offered students
a firsthand look at eco-friendly business practices, including waste reduction
and upcycling efforts.</p>

<p>A highlight of the trip was the hands-on activity where students upcycled
coconut husks—turning them into beautifully decorated planters for new
seedlings. This meaningful experience deepened their understanding of sustainable
living and inspired them to take small but impactful actions for the environment.</p>
