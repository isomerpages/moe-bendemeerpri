<p>The Media and Environment Club is in line with the school’s&nbsp;Applied
Learning Programme (ALP) with the focus on Environmental Sustainability.</p>
<p>We aim to nurture an appreciation for the environment and develop social
responsibility towards the environment among our students.</p>
<p>Our CCA members are the ambassadors who lead their school mates towards
a more sustainable future by caring for our environment. This will be achieved
through the main thrusts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Conducting school-wide programmes to raise awareness on environment issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting the recycling culture among students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working and collaborating with stakeholders on environment programmes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2024, the Environment Club embarked on enriching learning journeys
to the NEWater Visitor Centre and Gardens by the Bay.</p>
<p>At the NEWater Visitor Centre, students learned about Singapore's innovative
water conservation strategies and the advanced technologies behind its
sustainable drinking water supply. They gained a deeper understanding of
the nation's efforts to overcome resource challenges and ensure water security.</p>

<p>At Gardens by the Bay, students explored cutting-edge innovations and
creative designs that promote sustainability, while learning about Singapore’s
resource management. These experiences inspired students to think critically
about environmental challenges and innovative solutions for a sustainable
future.</p>

<p>Last year, our CCA members participated in a Learning Journey to an indoor
vertical farming facility. They learnt about food security and how we can
efficiently make use of limited space to grow food in an urban environment.
By experiencing the dynamic world of modern agriculture, the students were
able to appreciate how science and design thinking can come together to
provide a sustainable solution to real world challenges.</p>

<p>The Environment Club members honed their 21st Century Competencies by
learning to create basic app applications using Google AppSheet. They developed
two impactful apps: one compiling information on Singapore parks to promote
nature exploration and another guiding users on recycling right to encourage
sustainable habits. Through this project, they demonstrated critical and
inventive thinking, collaborative skills, and a sense of responsibility
towards the environment. The experience empowered them to use technology
as a tool for advocacy, showcasing how digital innovation can drive environmental
education and awareness.</p>

<h4>Earth Day 2024 - Planet vs. Plastics</h4>
<p>At Bendemeer Primary School, Earth Day is a celebration of our commitment
to the planet and a reminder of our responsibility to protect it. This
year theme "Planet vs Plastics" focusing on the urgent issue of plastic
pollution and its impact on our environment.</p>

<p>Our Media &amp; Environment Club members presented a talk during the morning
assembly, highlighting the harmful impacts of microplastics on our ecosystems.
As this celebration also coincided with Book Character Day, students were
encouraged to craft their costumes from recyclable materials, showcasing
their creativity and commitment to sustainability. Furthermore, students
delved into the heartwarming tale of "Ms. Jug Finds a Home," a story that
underscores the importance of repurposing materials and reducing waste.</p>

part of their Social Studies syllabus, were proudly showcased, highlighting
their efforts in waste reduction.</p>

<p>As we go beyond just one day, our commitment to taking care of the environment
stays strong at Bendemeer Primary School. Our efforts extend beyond Earth
Day; we continue working on projects to safeguard our planet for future
generations. Together, we're building a cleaner, greener world.</p>
