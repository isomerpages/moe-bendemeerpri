<p>In celebration of Earth Day, our school came together under the theme <em>Our Power, Our Planet</em> to
raise awareness about the importance of renewable energy and caring for
our environment. The Media and Environment Club kick-started the day with
an engaging school presentation, educating students on various types of
renewable energy and how they contribute to a more sustainable future.</p>

<p>During recess, students were treated to a fun and interactive puzzle-matching
game designed by members of the Media and Environment Clubs. The puzzles
were creatively made from recycled cereal boxes, reinforcing the message
of reusing materials to reduce waste.</p>

<p>In addition, an informative display board showcased how countries such
as Singapore, Canada, Japan, Sweden, and New Zealand are adopting renewable
energy practices. Through these visuals, students learned how global communities
are working towards a greener future and how they, too, can play a part.</p>

<p>It was a meaningful and educational event that reminded everyone that
protecting the planet starts with us.</p>
<h4>World Water Day 2025 - Glacier Preservation</h4>

</div>
<p>In support of the worldwide <em>World Water Day</em> movement, our school
focused this year’s theme on <em>Save Our Glaciers</em>. The Media and Environment
Clubs took the lead by researching glaciers across different continents
and exploring how global warming has caused them to shrink at an alarming
rate.</p>
<p></p>

</div>
<p>Through their presentation, the students shared how the melting of glaciers
not only threatens ecosystems but also affects human populations that rely
on glaciers for freshwater and stable climates. Their well-researched findings
were presented to the whole school, raising awareness about the urgent
need to protect these vital water sources.</p>
<p>The event reminded everyone that conserving water and fighting climate
change are global responsibilities—and it starts with being informed and
taking small actions in our daily lives.</p>

<p>In May, our Environmental Club members had an enriching learning journey
to Co+Nut+Ink on May, where they discovered how the company contributes
to sustainability and environmental stewardship. The visit offered students
a firsthand look at eco-friendly business practices, including waste reduction
and upcycling efforts.</p>
<p></p>

<p>A highlight of the trip was the hands-on activity where students upcycled
coconut husks—turning them into beautifully decorated planters for new
seedlings. This meaningful experience deepened their understanding of sustainable
living and inspired them to take small but impactful actions for the environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2024, our students went to Gardens by the Bay and explored cutting-edge
innovations and creative designs that promote sustainability, while learning
about Singapore’s resource management. These experiences inspired students
to think critically about environmental challenges and innovative solutions
for a sustainable future.</p>

<p>The Environment Club members honed their 21st Century Competencies by
learning to create basic app applications using Google AppSheet. They developed
two impactful apps: one compiling information on Singapore parks to promote
nature exploration and another guiding users on recycling right to encourage
sustainable habits. Through this project, they demonstrated critical and
inventive thinking, collaborative skills, and a sense of responsibility
towards the environment. The experience empowered them to use technology
as a tool for advocacy, showcasing how digital innovation can drive environmental
education and awareness.</p>
