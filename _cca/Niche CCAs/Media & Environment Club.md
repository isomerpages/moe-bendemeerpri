a more sustainable future by caring for our environment. This will be achieved
through the main thrusts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Conducting school-wide programmes to raise awareness on environment issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting the recycling culture among students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working and collaborating with stakeholders on environment programmes.</p>

<p>In celebration of Earth Day, our school came together under the theme <em>Our Power, Our Planet</em> to
raise awareness about the importance of renewable energy and caring for
our environment. The Environment Club kick-started the day with an engaging
school presentation, educating students on various types of renewable energy
and how they contribute to a more sustainable future.</p>

<p>During recess, students were treated to a fun and interactive puzzle-matching
game designed by members of the Media and Environment Clubs. The puzzles
were creatively made from recycled cereal boxes, reinforcing the message
of reusing materials to reduce waste.</p>

<p>In addition, an informative display board showcased how countries such
as Singapore, Canada, Japan, Sweden, and New Zealand are adopting renewable
energy practices. Through these visuals, students learned how global communities
are working towards a greener future and how they, too, can play a part.</p>

<p>It was a meaningful and educational event that reminded everyone that
protecting the planet starts with us.</p>

<p>In support of the worldwide <em>World Water Day</em> movement, our school
focused this year’s theme on <em>Save Our Glaciers</em>. The Media and Environment
Clubs took the lead by researching glaciers across different continents
and exploring how global warming has caused them to shrink at an alarming
rate.</p>
<p>Through their presentation, the students shared how the melting of glaciers
not only threatens ecosystems but also affects human populations that rely
on glaciers for freshwater and stable climates. Their well-researched findings
were presented to the whole school, raising awareness about the urgent
need to protect these vital water sources.</p>
<p>The event reminded everyone that conserving water and fighting climate
change are global responsibilities—and it starts with being informed and
taking small actions in our daily lives.</p>

<h4>Learning Journeys</h4>
<p>In 2024, the Environment Club embarked on enriching learning journeys
to the NEWater Visitor Centre and Gardens by the Bay.</p>
<p>At the NEWater Visitor Centre, students learned about Singapore's innovative
water conservation strategies and the advanced technologies behind its
sustainable drinking water supply. They gained a deeper understanding of
the nation's efforts to overcome resource challenges and ensure water security.</p>

<p>At Gardens by the Bay, students explored cutting-edge innovations and
creative designs that promote sustainability, while learning about Singapore’s
resource management. These experiences inspired students to think critically
about environmental challenges and innovative solutions for a sustainable
future.</p>

<p>The Environment Club members honed their 21st Century Competencies by
learning to create basic app applications using Google AppSheet. They developed
two impactful apps: one compiling information on Singapore parks to promote
nature exploration and another guiding users on recycling right to encourage
sustainable habits. Through this project, they demonstrated critical and
inventive thinking, collaborative skills, and a sense of responsibility
towards the environment. The experience empowered them to use technology
as a tool for advocacy, showcasing how digital innovation can drive environmental
education and awareness.</p>
