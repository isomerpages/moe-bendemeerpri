The Environmental Science Club is in line with the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) with the focus on Environmental Sustainability.  

We aim to nurture an appreciation for the environment and develop social responsibility towards the environment among our students. Our CCA members are also the ambassadors who lead their school mates towards a more sustainable future by caring for our environment. This will be achieved through the main thrusts:-  Conducting school-wide programmes to raise awareness on environment issues-  Promoting the recycling culture among students -  Working and collaborating with stakeholders on environment programmes.
