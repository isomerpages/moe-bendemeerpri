<p>The Media and Environment Club is in line with the schoolâ€™s&nbsp;Applied
Learning Programme (ALP) with the focus on Environmental Sustainability.</p>
<p>We aim to nurture an appreciation for the environment and develop social
responsibility towards the environment among our students.</p>
<p>Our CCA members are the ambassadors who lead their school mates towards
a more sustainable future by caring for our environment. This will be achieved
through the main thrusts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Conducting school-wide programmes to raise awareness on environment issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promoting the recycling culture among students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working and collaborating with stakeholders on environment programmes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our CCA exposes students to a variety of projects aimed at creating awareness
of sustainability. We also uniquely integrate basic coding applications
into our activities, empowering students to develop essential digital skills.
By incorporating coding, we aim to enhance their problem-solving abilities
and creativity. Moreover, this innovative approach allows our members to
create digital projects that promote environmental stewardship.</p>

<p>Last year, our CCA members participated in a Learning Journey to an indoor
vertical farming facility. They learnt about food security and how we can
efficiently make use of limited space to grow food in an urban environment.
By experiencing the dynamic world of modern agriculture, the students were
able to appreciate how science and design thinking can come together to
provide a sustainable solution to real world challenges.</p>

<p>Moreover, as part of our preparations for our school presentation on World
Water Day in Term 1, we embarked on a fascinating visit to the NEWater
Visitor Center. This excursion provided valuable insights into water conservation
and purification, further enriching our understanding of environmental
sustainability.</p>

<h4>Earth Day 2024 - Planet vs. Plastics</h4>
<p>At Bendemeer Primary School, Earth Day is a celebration of our commitment
to the planet and a reminder of our responsibility to protect it. This
year theme "Planet vs Plastics" focusing on the urgent issue of plastic
pollution and its impact on our environment.</p>

<p>Our Media &amp; Environment Club members presented a talk during the morning
assembly, highlighting the harmful impacts of microplastics on our ecosystems.
As this celebration also coincided with Book Character Day, students were
encouraged to craft their costumes from recyclable materials, showcasing
their creativity and commitment to sustainability. Furthermore, students
delved into the heartwarming tale of "Ms. Jug Finds a Home," a story that
underscores the importance of repurposing materials and reducing waste.</p>

part of their Social Studies syllabus, were proudly showcased, highlighting
their efforts in waste reduction.</p>

<p>As we go beyond just one day, our commitment to taking care of the environment
stays strong at Bendemeer Primary School. Our efforts extend beyond Earth
Day; we continue working on projects to safeguard our planet for future
generations. Together, we're building a cleaner, greener world.</p>
