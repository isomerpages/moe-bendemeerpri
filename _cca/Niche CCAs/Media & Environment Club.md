We aim to nurture an appreciation for the environment and develop social responsibility towards the environment among our students.

Our CCA members are the ambassadors who lead their school mates towards a more sustainable future by caring for our environment. This will be achieved through the main thrusts:

* Conducting school-wide programmes to raise awareness on environment issues.

* Promoting the recycling culture among students.

* Working and collaborating with stakeholders on environment programmes.
