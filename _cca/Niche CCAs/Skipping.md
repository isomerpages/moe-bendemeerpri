#### Introduction

Rope skipping is a sport where one or more participants jump over a rope swung so that it passes under their feet and over their heads. There are multiple subsets of rope skipping including: single freestyle, single speed, pairs, three person speed (Double Dutch), and three person freestyle (Double Dutch freestyle). The events are often separated by gender and age.

In freestyle events, jumpers use a variety of basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges, and performance judges.  In speed events, a jumper alternated their feet with the rope going around the jumper every time one of their feet hit the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, or three minutes.  The jumper is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.  Different techniques can be used when skipping and these can be used individually, or combined in a series, to create a routine. 

Rope skipping may be used as a cardiovascular workout, similar to jogging or bicycle riding, and has a high intensity level. Skipping for 15–20 minutes is enough to burn off the calories from a candy bar and is equivalent to 45–60 minutes of running depending upon the intensity of jumps and leg swings. Many professional trainers, fitness experts and professional fighters greatly recommend skipping for burning fat over any other alternative exercises like running and jogging.
