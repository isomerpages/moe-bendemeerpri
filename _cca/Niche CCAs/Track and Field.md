Track and field is a sport comprising athletic events on running, jumping, and throwing. The events in track include individual events such as 60m, 80m 120 metres, 200 metres, 1000 metres, 60 metres hurdles, 80 metres hurdles and team events such as 8 x 50 metres, 5 x 80m and 4 x 200 metres relays. Field events include high jump, scissors jump, long jump and shot put.</p><p>Track and field is an effective way to increase pupils’ cardiovascular fitness as well as maintain a healthy weight. Through track and field, pupils develop a passion for exercising and healthy habits that will stay with them for life.</p><h4>Objectives</h4><p>During training, coaches and teachers work together to train our student-athletes in foot-work, endurance-building exercises, and team-work. These training sessions reinforce the importance of passion, resilience, and diligence and help to build all-rounded athletes. Through competitions, the student-athletes learn about integrity, championing good sportsmanship and see the fruit of their labour from their rigorous training sessions. They also learn to empathise with their fellow athletes regardless of the result and appreciate the diversity of student-athletes from all over Singapore.</p><h4>Achievements</h4><p>National School Games Track &amp; Field Championships 2022<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2nd position in Junior 1 Boys Scissors Jump<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5th position in Junior 1 Boys 1000 metres<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8th position in Junior 1 Boys Long Jump<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6th position in Junior 1 Boys 8 x 50 metres Relay<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1st position in Junior 2 Boys Medicine Ball Throw<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2nd position in Junior 2 Boys Scissors Jump</p><p></p><p>National School Games Track &amp; Field Championships 2023<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bronze Pin in Junior 1 Boys Multi-Skill Event<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8th position in Junior 1 Boys 1000 metres<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4th position in Junior 1 Boys Medicine Ball Throw (2 kg)<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7th position in Junior 1 Boys 8 x 50 Metres Relay<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bronze Pin in Junior 1 Girls Multi-Skill Event<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3rd position in Junior 1 Girls Scissors Jump<br>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8th position in&nbsp; Junior 2 Boys 4 x 50 Metres Relay</p><h4>Photos/Gallery</h4><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Track_1.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 80%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Track_2.jpg"></div><p></p><p></p><p></p>
