#### Introduction
The Track and Field CCA was started in 2019. Track and field is a sport comprising athletic events on running, jumping, and throwing. The events in track include individual events such as 100 metres, 200 metres, 300 metres, 600 metres, 1500 metres, 60 metres hurdles, 80 metres hurdles, 100 metres hurdles and team events such as 4 x 100 metres and 4 x 300 metres relays. Field events include high jump, long jump and shot put.  
Track and field is an effective way to increase pupils’ cardiovascular fitness as well as maintain a healthy weight. Through Track and field, pupils develop a passion for exercising and healthy habits that will stay with them for life.

#### Objectives
During training, coaches and teachers work together to train our student-athletes in foot-work, endurance-building exercises, and team-work. These training sessions reinforce the importance of passion, resilience, and diligence and help to build all-rounded athletes. 
Through competitions, the student-athletes learn about integrity, championing good sportsmanship and see the fruit of their labour from their rigorous training sessions. They also learn to empathise with their fellow athletes regardless of the result and appreciate the diversity of student-athletes from all over Singapore.
