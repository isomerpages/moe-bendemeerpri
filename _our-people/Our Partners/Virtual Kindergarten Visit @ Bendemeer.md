### VIRTUAL KINDERGARTEN VISIT @ BENDEMEER

**Virtual Kindergarten Visit@Bendemeer**

The school **hosted 17 kindergartens to a virtual school visit** on 15 April as part of our Community Outreach effort to prepare the Kindergarten pupils for primary school. The zoom session also addressed the queries of the K2 parents that were collated by the participating kindergartens. Ben, our school mascot was featured together with our student leaders in a skit about life in Bendemeer Primary. Our Head Prefect and Vice-Head Prefect also joined our staff in answering questions from the younger children.
