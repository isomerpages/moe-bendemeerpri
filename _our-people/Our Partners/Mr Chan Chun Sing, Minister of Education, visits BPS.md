### MR CHAN CHUN SING, MINISTER OF EDUCATION VISITS BPS

On 24 May 2022, Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Education Singapore, visited our school, Bendemeer Primary School where he had dialogues with students and staff.  
  
These dialogue sessions were enriching and informative as both students and staff truly enjoyed the interactions with Mr Chan where they shared on the events and happenings as a student and staff in our school.
