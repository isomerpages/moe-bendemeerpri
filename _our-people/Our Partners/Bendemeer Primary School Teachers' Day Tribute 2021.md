### BENDEMEER PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS' DAY TRIBUTE 2021

**Thank You’ Cher! You are ‘Our Shining Stars, Our Inspiration’!**

Bendemeer Primary School Teachers’ Day Tribute 2021

It has been more than 18 months since Covid-19 disrupted the rhythm of school life. Over this time, educators have coped with many changes – rapidly upskilling for FHBL, keeping students learning while following the safe management measures in accordance with the national posture. All through these ups and downs, educators have been indefatigable. They have stayed steadfast to their mission, shown their innovative spirit and sense of fraternity.

You are warmly invited to pen your Teachers’ Day good wishes at [www.tinyurl.com/2nbnd27r](http://www.tinyurl.com/2nbnd27r) that is exclusively created by our school for our Bendemeer family and alumni!

At the same time, MOE has created the Gratitude Portal to thank our educators in Singapore and uplift their spirits during this challenging time. You are invited to pen your good wishes (as a student, alumni, teacher or parent) from Wednesday, 25 August, 2021, when this portal becomes available at [https://thankyoucher.edu.sg/](https://thankyoucher.edu.sg/). Messages can also be accompanied by a photo or image. After Teachers’ Day, MOE will compile and send all messages to Bendemeer Primary School at the end of the campaign as a gift to the teachers.

You can also read others’ messages across Singapore schools, and explore videos and articles on teachers (and their good work). Posts are tagged by school, and submissions can be filtered to show posts thanking teachers, and staff of individual schools.

Let’s take the opportunity to show our gratitude to the teachers who have made a positive difference and tell them the reasons they are ‘Our Shining Stars, Our Inspiration’!
