### OUR PARTNERS

The Partnership & PSG Committee of Bendemeer Primary School endeavours to forge and sustain meaningful partnerships by working with the community both from within and out. We never cease from connecting with our partners because we believe that we can work together hand-in-hand to nurture our students to be the best they can be and this is signified by the icon of a handshake in the bottom-right section of our school crest.  

**<u>Partnership From Within</u>**

**Our Signature Community Festive Outreach event**

The Covid-19 situation ignited a very important partnership opportunity for us. Since the Partnership & PSG Committee could not perform our annual Festive Outreach within our immediate neighbourhood community, we connected with our non-teaching staff! Our school leaders and students presented the following festive gifts to our non-teaching staff:

**<u>Partnership with the Community</u>**

**Saluting our SBS Transit Bus Captains!**

SBS Transit invited our school to participate in SBS Transit Kindness Month in November 2021. Our students shared about which buses they took to school and they also expressed their gratitude to the diligent and committed bus captains in a video clip which was featured on SBS Transit’s Facebook. The video clip was also screened to the Minister for Transport of Singapore, Mr Chee Hong Tat, and guests during the Public Transport Workers' Appreciation Event 2021.

**Kindergarten E-Visit @ BPS 2022**  

As part of our community outreach effort to prepare Kindergarten students for primary school, our school hosted 24 kindergartens on an E-Visit on 13 April 2022. This experience provided both the K2 students and their parents with a timely opportunity to learn about the interesting programmes, infrastructure and latest facilities Bendemeer Primary School has to offer. Ben, our school mascot, was featured together with our student leaders in a video about life in BPS. There were also many light-hearted moments when our Head Prefect, Jeannette Tham Shi Tong of 6 Adaptability, and Vice-Head Prefect, Goh Ying Hui Zoey also of 6 Adaptability, answered questions from the curious younger kinder!

**SCDF Junior Lionhearter Challenge 2022**  

A group of P4 and P5 National Education (NE) Champs took park in the SCDF Junior Lionhearter Challenge 2022 organised by the Singapore Civil Defence Force. They participated in a series of exciting activities which included them rallying their family members to download the SCDF’s myResponder app and to register as Community First Responders.

These NE Champs were also trained to serve as Emergency Preparedness (EP) ambassadors in own schools, spreading awareness amongst their fellow schoolmates, family members and friends on the importance of knowing life-saving skills and helping one another in an emergency.

**Virtual Partnership – Friendship Beyond Boundaries**  

We had our inaugural virtual immersion with Sichuan Da Yi Bei Jie Primary School (大邑县北街小学) on 22 April 2022. The theme of ‘Friendship Beyond Boundaries’ was apparent and achieved as the students and teachers from both schools warmly welcomed one another, watched cultural performances and proceeded to work together to create lovely flower craftwork which symbolises unity, friendship and happiness. This immersion programme has not only allowed our students to connect with their foreign counterparts, but it also affirms the friendship and partnership between both schools.

**Rubik’s Cube friendly tournament organised by BPS’s partner school**  

When was the last time you played with a ‘Rubik’s cube’? Our partner school from Chengdu, ‘Chengdu ShiShi High School’ ([石室中学](https://web.archive.org/web/20150626070856/http:/www.cdshishi.net/its/trans.aspx?id=2608)) organised a Rubik’s cube tournament for their students on 31 May 2022 and Bendemeer Primary was invited to participate virtually alongside the Chengdu students. Amidst our P6 students, there were some who possessed this hidden talent and were very proficient with Rubik’s Cube! They played a friendly match with 6 Integrity cheering on as spectators. It was very heart-warming to see both schools sharing applause and words of encouragement! The Chengdu school commended that one of our students completed the Rubik’s cube puzzle in 30 seconds which was considered lightning fast! This tournament was held in conjunction with other activities as part of Children’s Day in China on 1 June 2022.
