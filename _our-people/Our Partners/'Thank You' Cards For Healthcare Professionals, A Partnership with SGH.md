### 'THANK YOU' CARDS FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, A PARTNERSHIP WITH SGH

As part of Values in Action (VIA) in Character and Citizenship Education, the Primary four students wrote ‘Thank You’ cards to express their heartfelt gratitude towards our healthcare professionals and to encourage them to stay safe and healthy during this Covid-19 period. The cards were sent to our healthcare professionals at Singapore General Hospital (SGH). SGH then thanked our students and teachers for this very kind gesture.
