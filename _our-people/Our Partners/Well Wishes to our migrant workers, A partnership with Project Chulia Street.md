### WELL WISHES TO OUR MIGRANT WORKERS - A PARTNERSHIP WITH PROJECT CHULIA STREET

With the recent rise in cases of migrant workers contracting Covid-19, Bendemeer Primary School, in partnership with Project Chulia Street, an organisation serving to bond and to support migrant workers in Singapore, produced a special video of our students from all levels saying well wishes to our migrant workers. We want to affirm their tireless contribution towards Singapore and for them to know that our students and staff support them during this difficult time. #SGUnited, #BPSUnited
