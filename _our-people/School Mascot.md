<p><strong>Launch of School Mascot</strong>
</p>
<p>Bendemeer Primary School proudly launched our school’s very own mascot
– ‘Ben’ The Otter on 3rd&nbsp;February 2020. As Ben danced and made his
grand entrance, students welcomed him by waving their mini otter flags
excitedly. Our school adopted the otter to be the role model mascot due
to their positive attributes and values such as teamwork, passion and resilience.</p>
<p>Prefects worked as a team to brainstorm a variety of names and presented
to the school to get the students to vote for their favourite name for
the mascot. The objective of launching a mascot is to create loyal supporters
of our students, staff and parents as it will be a recognizable symbol
of our school. It also represents the values every Bendemeer student should
cultivate and exhibit from the otter’s family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ben is now a new member who has joined our Bendemeer family and will always
be part of our school’s future vital events.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Digital Illustrations of Ben</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the introduction of our school mascot, BEN the otter, last year,
Bendemeer Primary School has launched the digital illustrations of BEN
in eight different images. This is to encourage our staff to use these
digital illustrations in their department’s projects, presentations and
posters&nbsp;to&nbsp;highlight and reinforce our ASPIRE values to our students
in a fun and lively way. Ben is our</p>
<p><strong>School’s Values Ambassador.</strong>&nbsp;He serves to reinforce&nbsp;<strong>key messages and values</strong>&nbsp;that
every student should aspire towards. He also represents the different vital
aspects of our school. The eight images are namely Ben the&nbsp;<strong>Explorer, Learner, Host, Values Ambassador, Athlete, Musician, Artist and ICT Champ.</strong>
