### PARENT SUPPORT GROUP (PSG)

The School’s Parent Support Group (PSG) was formed by a group of parents who have a keen interest in contributing towards the school community and who readily impart their skills / render their services to the school.  Over the years, the PSG has forged a strong and trusted relationship with the school.

The PSG is now a motivated and innovative voluntary wing of our school’s Pupil Management Department.  The school and the community have benefited much from activities supported by the PSG over the years.  We are looking forward to recruiting more parent volunteers to help the PSG grow even further.  We would like to invite parents to share their skills and area of expertise with the pupils and staff.

  

##### Objectives:  

To provide opportunities for parents to be involved in the school activities <br>
To foster greater bonding between school and families <br>
To give children a sense of pride as they witness the involvement of their parents in school
 

##### Benefits 

As a PSG member, parents can keep abreast with the school’s programmes. You will be better able to support and guide your child when you are well-informed about the school policies and curriculum in your child’s school. By joining the PSG, you will also gain the support from other parents in your parenting endeavour through this network and therefore strengthening positive parent-child relationship with your child.
