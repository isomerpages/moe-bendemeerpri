### PRIMARY 1 & 2

#### Primary 1  

Our Primary 1 students embarked on our inaugural Primary 1 ALP lessons which was integrated into the English lesson this year. The focus was on **water pollution** and helping our school mascot, Ben the Otter, to **ensure that Singapore’s waterways are clean**. Students planned their designs on paper and thereafter, using their creativity, they used LEGO to build their prototype. The students thoroughly enjoyed themselves! Through this lesson package, students learnt teamwork, resilience and also become more aware of the environmental issues.

#### Primary 2

P2 ALP is an interdisciplinary platform that allows students to hone their collaborative and communication skills. Students first go on a Jacob Ballas Garden virtual tour to understand the concept of a sustainable environment. Then, through simplified Design Thinking, they brainstorm and design prototype props and costumes which can be used for their Readers’ Theatre Performance. Finally, students collect and select appropriate recyclable materials to build their prototypes for their performance.
