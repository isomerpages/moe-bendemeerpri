<p><strong>P5 ALP Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The P5 students are engaged in ALP on the construction of a sustainable
home.</p>
<p>As part of their learning, they undergo a cohort-level Design Thinking
workshop, where they explore the five phasesâ€”Empathize, Define, Ideate,
Prototype, and Test. This training equips them with the skills to create
and refine their sustainable home designs.</p>

<p>To enhance their experience, students integrate micro:bit programming
into their prototypes. This has enabled every group of students to have
at least 1 sustainable feature using a microbit sensor.&nbsp;Our students
have gone through an enriching learning journey that has given them many
opportunities to exercise the transfer of learning seamlessly from their
design-thinking workshop to their microbit programming into their ALP project
on building a sustainable home using recyclables(as part of the Makers
Education).</p>
