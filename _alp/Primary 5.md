<p><strong>P5 ALP Programme 2022:</strong>
</p>
<p>The P 5 students are engaged in ALP on the construction of a sustainable
home.</p>
<p>Early this year in term 1, they have undergone a cohort level Design Thinking
training whereby they learnt the 5 phases such as Empathize, Define, Ideate
Prototype and Test to create a design and make their sustainable home.</p>

<p>In addition,&nbsp;our studentsâ€™ learning experience has been enhanced
by integrating microbit programming into their prototype. This has enabled
every group of students to have at least 1 sustainable feature using a
microbit sensor.&nbsp;Our students have gone through an enriching learning
journey that has given them many opportunities to exercise the transfer
of learning seamlessly from their design-thinking workshop to their microbit
programming into their ALP project on building a sustainable home using
recyclables(as part of the Makers Education).</p>
