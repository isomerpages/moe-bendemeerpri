**P5 ALP Programme 2022:**

The P 5 students are engaged in ALP on the construction of a sustainable home.

Early this year in term 1, they have undergone a cohort level Design Thinking training whereby they learnt the 5 phases such as Empathize, Define, Ideate Prototype and Test to create a design and make their sustainable home.

In addition,&nbsp;our studentsâ€™ learning experience has been enhanced by integrating microbit programming into their prototype. This has enabled every group of students to have at least 1 sustainable feature using a microbit sensor.&nbsp;Our students have gone through an enriching learning journey that has given them many opportunities to exercise the transfer of learning seamlessly from their design-thinking workshop to their microbit programming into their ALP project on building a sustainable home using recyclables(as part of the Makers Education).
