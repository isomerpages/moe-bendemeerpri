<p><strong>Value Proposition</strong>
</p>
<p>Develop future-ready students
<br>Nurture a gracious community of students
<br>Educate our students to be environmentally conscious
<br>Encourage our students to be proactive in adopting initiatives for sustainable
living and environmental education</p>
<p>At Bendemeer Primary School, we believe in developing future-ready students
and equipping them with the dispositions and skills to help them embrace
their future with confidence. It is our school’s vision and mission to
nurture a gracious community of students who will make a difference in
the lives of others. We recognize that this would include educating our
students to understand the challenges and problems faced by the world today
with regard to environmental issues. We want to encourage our students
to explore and consider ways in which they can proactively play their part
in being a part of the solution and adopting lifestyles for sustainable
living and a healthier world.</p>
<p>Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) –&nbsp;<strong>Environment Education &amp; Sustainable Living@BPS (E2SL@BPS)</strong>&nbsp;aims
to be the catalyst to ignite the interest of our students and provide them
with environmental conservation knowledge and platforms for transfer and
application of learning through real life problems and hands-on experiences.
Based on E2SL@BPS, E2 (Environment Education) is to teach students on the
impacts of man’s actions on the environment while Sustainable Living is
to inculcate a lifestyle that attempts to reduce an individual’s or society’s
use of the Earth’s natural resources and personal resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through our ALP, our P2 to P6 students will use their knowledge gained
about environmental issues to propose innovative ideas and solutions towards
authentic problems faced by their community. It is our belief that they
can be advocates for change and promote environmental conservation and
sustainable living in their homes and communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Based on the school’s mission, vision and values, every Bendemeer
student is a passionate learner who can learn and lead. Hence, E2SL will
empower our students with the knowledge, values and dispositions to make
environment friendly decisions for sustainable living. This programme is
delivered to students through the E3A approach (Exposure, Engagement, Extension,
Awareness &amp; Advocacy), with a focus on Science, Technology, Engineering,
Aesthetics and Mathematics (STEAM).</p>

<p>All students are given opportunities to ignite their curiosity about real-world
problems in the areas of sustainable development and care for the environment.
Through the design-thinking platform, students are encouraged to think
inventively and come up with innovative and practical solutions to these
problems. At the lower and middle primary, lesson packages are crafted
with design thinking protocols built into them.</p>
<p>For upper primary, design thinking protocols are explicitly taught. To
evaluate student’s learning in ALP, perception surveys will be administered
to students at the end of each programme to gather feedback on their learning
experience, identify the challenges faced as well as measure the skills
and values acquired.&nbsp;E2SL@BPS learning is an interdisciplinary approach
going beyond the boundaries of a classroom, leveraging on appropriate ICT
tools to foster the joy of learning. The school will be conducting a number
of learning journeys to places of interest with the infusion of environmental
education. These LJs are interdisciplinary in nature, involving collaboration
between different departments.</p>
<p>In line with our school’s mission: ‘Nurturing and inspiring students to
love learning, lead confidently and make a difference in the life of others’,
the Makers’ Innovation Lab was opened in 2022. It is a space that provides
hands-on, creative ways to encourage students to design, experiment, build
and invent as they deeply engage in science, engineering, and tinkering.
Most of the subject matter revolves around Science, Engineering, Technology,
Arts and Maths linking to the acronym STEAM (learning). As our school's
Applied Learning Programme is focused on Sustainable Living &amp; Environment
Education, the activities that students experience in this lab will concentrate
on tinkering projects that is aligned to this theme. In addition, this
lab will also serve as a platform for student leaders to help their younger
schoolmates. The latter is achieved with facilitation, guidance, and the
peer coaching. An example is the P4 Recess Lego activity.&nbsp;The main
objective activity is to allow students to use Lego resources to develop
creative projects in line with environment education and sustainable living.
In term 1 week 7, all English, Math, Science and PAM &nbsp;teachers in
P1 to P5 attended a PD on Makers Education to learn how to facilitate a
Maker activity using the various activities from the Maker’s cart.</p>

<p><strong><u>Staff development</u></strong> 
<br>A school-wide design thinking training for all P5 teachers on design thinking
protocols is carried out to equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge
to facilitate the conduct of P5 ALP lessons.
<br>E2SL committee members go for learning journeys to schools with ALP and
Maker Education to learn from their best practices.</p>
