<h3>P5 INNOVATION DAY 2023</h3>
<p>Bendemeer Primary School embarked on our Applied Learning Programme (ALP)
–<strong> Environment Education &amp; Sustainable Living@BPS (E2SL@BPS)</strong> to
ignite the interest of our students and provide them with environmental
conservation knowledge and platforms for the transfer and application of
learning through real life problems and hands-on experiences.</p>
<p>Aligned to our nation’s emphasis on sustainable living and green practices,
our Primary 5 students were tasked to design a sustainable home as part
of the ALP project. In term 1, they underwent a design-thinking workshop
to equip them with problem-solving skills which they applied to the building
of their sustainable home design. To further enhance our students’ learning,
we have also integrated Micro:bit programming which students used in at
least one feature of their sustainable home. It has been an enriching learning
journey for our students as they consider the impact Man has on his environment
and how one can do their part to save the Earth and advocate for sustainable
living practices.</p>
