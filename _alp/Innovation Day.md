### INNOVATION DAY 2022

Bendemeer Primary School embarked on our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – **Environment Education & Sustainable Living@BPS (E2SL@BPS)** to ignite the interest of our students and provide them with environmental conservation knowledge and platforms for the transfer and application of learning through real life problems and hands-on experiences.

Aligned to our nation’s emphasis on sustainable living and green practices, our Primary 5 students were tasked to design a sustainable home as part of the ALP project. In term 1 week 3, they underwent a design-thinking workshop to equip them with problem-solving skills which they applied to the building of their sustainable home design. To further enhance our students’ learning, we have also integrated Micro:bit programming which students used in at least one feature of their sustainable home. It has been an enriching learning journey for our students as they consider the impact Man has on his environment and how one can do their part to save the Earth and advocate for sustainable living practices.

On 27 July, Wednesday, from 2 – 3pm, parents were invited to view the Innovation Day presentations from their child’s class. The best 2 projects from every P5 class carried out their presentation in our Maker’s Innovation Lab.

In addition, all P5 classes have also filmed their presentation (1 video per group)

The video link has been sent to the respective parents by class on parent gateway on 29 July 2022.
