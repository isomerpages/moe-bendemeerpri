### COHORT LEADERSHIP TRAINING

The Cohort Leadership trainings were conducted for both the Primary 3 and 4 students. These trainings scaffold the students learning in 3 levels namely as a leader, a team builder and a communicator. The Primary 4 students were given the opportunity to work with their peers to design games suitable for the elderly using the concept of upcycling materials while the Primary 3 students designed stationery items. After designing their own games, the students had to use recycled materials to construct the games which they had designed.

At the end of the training, students gave a short presentation on the concept of their games. They were taught social awareness by understanding the role of a team leader and the importance of making responsible decisions.
