### VALUES TALK FOR P1 & P2 BY P5 SENIOR PREFECTS

Under the guidance of our student leadership teachers, the P5 prefects were given the opportunity to engage the lower primary students through values talk, conducted during recess time.  
  
Not only did this Outreach Programme helped to strengthen the confidence of the prefects, it also allowed the lower primary students to learn more about Bendemeer Primaryâ€™s school values from a different perspective which was crafted by our own students after the school merger.  
  
This Values Talk also shared information on how the new school uniform and the naming of our school mascot were carried out to the lower primary students.
