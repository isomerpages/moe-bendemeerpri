<h3><strong>Prefects’ Investiture - Communicate to Lead, Connect to Inspire</strong></h3>
<p>On 26 March 2025, Bendemeer Primary School proudly held its annual Prefects’
Investiture Ceremony, a meaningful occasion to formally welcome and celebrate
our newly appointed prefects from Primary 3 to 6, including the Executive
Committee (EXCO) prefects.</p>
<p>Centred around this year’s student leadership theme, "Communicate to Lead,
Connect to Inspire," the ceremony highlighted the power of communication
in leadership – emphasising how prefects can build stronger relationships,
foster unity, and uplift the school community through their words and actions.</p>

<p>The ceremony began with a warm welcome and an inspiring address by our
Principal, Mrs Tan, who reminded all students that true leadership begins
with ownership and service. The procession of prefects – from our new Primary
3 leaders to our seasoned Primary 6 prefects – marked a proud moment for
the school, showcasing the breadth of student leadership across the levels.</p>

<p>One of the most heartfelt moments of the ceremony was the EXCO Tie-Pinning
Ceremony, where each EXCO prefect honoured a teacher who had played a significant
role in their growth. In front of the school, they presented a token of
appreciation to their selected mentor – a symbolic gesture celebrating
the strong student-teacher bonds that continue to shape our young leaders.</p>

<p>This year’s Executive Committee is helmed by Head Prefect Insiyah Hozefa,
supported by Vice-Head Prefects Zhang Qishan and Tan Le Shuen, alongside
their fellow EXCO members: Shofiyyatus, Jabirah, Skyler Wang, Hamana Yuito,
Valerie Lee, and Axelle Goh. Together, they form the core leadership team
guiding the prefects through the year with dedication, integrity, and heart.</p>

<p>The ceremony concluded with the recitation of the Prefects’ Oath, led
confidently by Head Prefect Insiyah, and her moving speech, which inspired
her fellow prefects to lead with empathy, courage, and a commitment to
making a difference.</p>
<p>As we look ahead to the year, Bendemeer Primary School remains confident
in the potential of our prefects to be not just responsible role models,
but also compassionate leaders who communicate with purpose and connect
with sincerity. We look forward to seeing them lead with heart, uphold
our ASPIRE values, and leave a lasting impact on the school and beyond.</p>
<p>Congratulations once again to our 2025 Prefectorial Board!</p>
