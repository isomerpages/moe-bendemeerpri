<h3><strong>Prefects’ Investiture - Honouring Our Leaders</strong></h3>
<p>On 20 February 2024, Bendemeer Primary School held our Prefects’ Investiture
Ceremony, celebrating the leadership journey of our P3 to P6 prefects and
the Executive Committee (EXCO) prefects for 2024. Embracing the theme <strong>‘Shaping Leaders through Good Habits'</strong>,
the ceremony emphasised our dedication to fostering leadership through
positive daily behaviours and the embodiment of our ASPIRE (Adaptability,
Self-discipline, Passion, Integrity, Resilience, Empathy) values.</p>

the Prefect’s Oath, reaffirming their commitment to lead with honour. The
meticulous selection of our prefects highlights our dedication to cultivating
leaders who are instrumental in fostering a vibrant and resilient school
community.</p>

<p>A heartfelt moment unfolded during the EXCO Prefect Tie-pinning Ceremony,
as each prefect paid tribute to a teacher who had profoundly influenced
their journey, highlighting the significant student-teacher bond. This
year, expressions of gratitude took the form of personal letters, adding
an extra layer of poignancy to the appreciation for these inspirational
educators.</p>
<p>Upon reflection of this year's ceremony, we are reminded of the impactful
blend of mentorship, leadership, and the pursuit of excellence. Moving
forward, Bendemeer Primary is excited to support both our new and existing
prefects, drawing inspiration from the shining examples set by their predecessors.
As we continue to uphold our ASPIRE values within our school, community,
and beyond, we are excited for the journey ahead!</p>
