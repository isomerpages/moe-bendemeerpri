### PREFECTS INVESTITURE 

On 20th February 2023, Bendemeer Primary School held its annual Prefects’ Investiture during our assembly. This is an event where we formally officiate and congratulate the appointments of our P3 to P6 prefects and our Executive Committee 2023.

The Prefectorial Board is part of the Student Leadership Body and they exhibit our school values ASPIRE through their daily school duties.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the ceremony, our Head Prefect, Atharva Saxena of P6 Adaptability led the newly appointed Exco Prefects in reciting the Prefect’s Oath, reaffirming their commitment towards leading and serving the school with pride.

The prefects went through a rigorous selection process. After being selected, they will be assigned duties to help with the function of the school on a daily basis.

Each of the EXCO Prefect invited a teacher who had impacted and inspired them to the investiture by giving them the honour to place the EXCO Prefect tie pin on their ties. In return, the EXCO Prefects expressed their gratitude for their teachers by presenting them with a handmade paper rose as a symbol of their gratitude.
