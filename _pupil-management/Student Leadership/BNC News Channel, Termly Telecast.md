### BNC NEWS - TERMLY TELECAST

BNC channel was launched last June. Moving forward, the objective of this platform was to telecast all student leadership programs and events in school run by our student leaders such as National Education Champions, Lead Librarians, PE Monitors, Environmental Ambassadors and finally not forgetting our Prefects. 

Bendemeer Primary is proud to say that the news reporters and news casters are our student leaders. It is evident from the telecast that the student leaders’ confidence level was boosted and they spoke eloquently, articulated fluently and presented confidently.
