<h4><strong>EXCO Prefect Handover Ceremony - Growing Our Leaders</strong></h4>
<p>During this yearâ€™s EXCO Prefect Handover Ceremony, Bendemeer Primary School
celebrated the important event of growing our leaders as the P6 EXCO prefects
passed the baton to the newly appointed P5 EXCO prefects. This symbolic
gesture of <em>'passing the baton' </em>represents the official transfer
of their duties and responsibilities, highlighting the ongoing growth and
development of leadership within our school.</p>

<p>Each of our P6 EXCO prefects has carried the baton of responsibility with
excellence. The act of <em>'passing the baton'</em> also symbolises the continuous
journey and shared responsibility, much like in a relay race. Each team
member plays a vital role in bringing the baton forward, closer to the
finish line. Even after the baton is passed, all members remain part of
the same team, continuing to work together towards a common goal.</p>

<p>In the same spirit, our P6 EXCO team will continue to nurture and guide
their juniors, ensuring they succeed in their new roles. Now, it is time
to hand over this baton to the next generation of leaders, who will continue
to grow and thrive, carrying forward the legacy of leadership with dedication
and commitment.</p>
<h4><strong>Head Prefect Election 2024 - Shaping Our Leaders</strong></h4>
<p>The annual Head Prefect Election is a significant event at Bendemeer Primary
School, where we focus on shaping a leader who will guide and inspire our
student body. This process not only fosters leadership skills among students
but also promotes active engagement within our school community. The Head
Prefect, along with other student leaders, are entrusted with important
responsibilities such as:</p>

year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Representing BPS and being good host for visitors</p>

</ul>

<p>This year, the journey to shaping our new Head Prefect began with the
2023/2024 EXCO Prefect Handover Ceremony on 29 July 2024. Following this,
three candidates were introduced to the school, each delivering heartfelt
speeches outlining their goals and vision if elected.</p>

<p>The candidates then engaged with their peers during recess over two days,
running creative canvassing campaigns to earn the votes of their fellow
schoolmates.</p>
