### ‘FOR STUDENTS BY STUDENTS’ PROJECT


##### Selection of snack break and dismissal songs

School is not just about having fun and learning. Here in Bendemeer Primary, we want to make sure that students’ voices are heard and students are given the opportunity to make certain decisions with regards to the school. As such, the EXCO Prefects were given the task of conducting a school wide poll to allow the student population to vote for their snack break and dismissal songs. The EXCO Prefects went around to the different recesses and conducted engagement talks to explain how the students are able to vote for their snack break and dismissal songs.
