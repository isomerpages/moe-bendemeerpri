<p>Good leaders are those who lead others towards the path of growth and
progress by carrying the torch of wisdom. Our student leadership’s motto, <em>We as Learners Aspire to be Tomorrow’s Leaders,</em> aims
to develop passionate learners and confident leaders by nurturing and inspiring
them to love learning, lead confidently, and make a difference in the lives
of others.</p>
