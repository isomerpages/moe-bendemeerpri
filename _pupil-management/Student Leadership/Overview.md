Good leaders are those who lead others towards the path of growth and progress by carrying the torch of wisdom. Our student leadership’s motto, _We as Learners Aspire to be Tomorrow’s Leaders,_ aims to develop passionate learners and confident leaders by nurturing and inspiring them to love learning, lead confidently, and make a difference in the lives of others.
