<h3><strong>STARm Student Leadership Camp - Developing Our Leaders</strong></h3>
<p>On 11 October 2024, our P5 Prefects took part in the Serving Together
As Role Models (STARm) Student Leadership Camp hosted by St Andrew's Secondary
School. Centred around the theme ‘Connecting Hearts, Connecting Communities,’
the camp offered a focused afternoon of learning and collaboration.</p>

<p>During the camp, our leaders delved into the concept of Servant Leadership,
with a particular focus on the 4 core principles: Listening, Awareness,
Persuasion, and Community Building. These principles are foundational for
leaders who aspire to serve their communities with empathy and effectiveness.
While the camp was led by student leaders from St Andrew's, who may still
be honing their skills, they facilitated the sessions with enthusiasm and
dedication.</p>

<p>The camp allowed our student leaders to explore social and environmental
issues within a safe and supportive environment. Through group work, they
brainstormed ideas for community projects, applying the Servant Leadership
principles to real-world challenges. This hands-on approach highlighted
the importance of leadership that is grounded in service and collaboration.</p>

<p>Though the camp was brief, it was a powerful experience that strengthened
the bonds among our leaders and reinforced their commitment to serving
as role models. They returned with fresh ideas and a renewed sense of purpose,
eager to apply what they learned to their leadership roles in school.</p>

<p>We are excited to see how the lessons from the STARm Student Leadership
Camp will inspire our student leaders to continue Serving Together as Role
Models in our school community.</p>
