### Bendemeer News Channel: Unleashing the Power of Video Journalism

At Bendemeer School, we believe in providing our students with diverse opportunities to explore their talents and develop valuable skills. One such avenue is the Bendemeer News Channel, a platform where our prefects showcase their creativity, communication skills, and passion for journalism. Through this video journalism initiative, our prefects become the reporters, using their inquisitive minds to brainstorm compelling questions and select interviewees to feature in their news segments.

The Bendemeer News Channel serves as an incredible platform for our prefects to practice essential skills like public speaking and presentation. Each prefect involved in the project is given the opportunity to enhance their communication abilities, delivering interviews and news reports with confidence and clarity. This hands-on experience not only nurtures their public speaking skills but also hones their ability to engage an audience effectively.

One remarkable example of the Bendemeer News Channel's impact is its coverage of the P5 IGNITE program. The video journalism team captures the essence of this program, highlighting the school values instilled in the participants. Through compelling storytelling and insightful interviews, they portray the spirit of Bendemeer School and the values that drive our students' development.

The resulting video is then shared during our school's ASPIRE Wednesday, a day dedicated to promoting character development and fostering a values-driven environment. The Bendemeer News Channel's video serves as a catalyst for reflection, prompting all students to ponder how they can also embody the ASPIRE values in their daily activities within the school.

The Bendemeer News Channel is not only an avenue for prefects to express their creativity and journalistic flair, but also a medium that fosters a culture of excellence and character-building within our school community. Through video journalism, our prefects are equipped with essential skills, allowing them to become confident communicators and leaders of tomorrow.

Stay tuned to the Bendemeer News Channel for more exciting news updates and inspiring stories from our talented prefects.
