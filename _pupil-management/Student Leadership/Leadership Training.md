<h3>LEADERSHIP TRAINING</h3>
<h4><strong>Primary 3 Cohort Leadership Programme</strong></h4>
<p>At Bendemeer Primary School, we believe that every child can be a leader.
The Primary 3 Cohort Leadership Programme introduces students to the basics
of self-leadership through fun, hands-on activities that build teamwork,
communication, and problem-solving skills.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Designed to be age-appropriate and engaging, the programme includes role-plays,
group challenges, and reflection tasks that help students understand what
it means to be responsible, respectful, and resilient in a team. Students
work together to solve problems, take on different roles, and learn how
their actions can influence those around them.</p>

<p>The programme is closely aligned with our school’s ASPIRE values and 21st
Century Competencies (21CC), allowing students to build leadership habits
that grow with them. Each child receives a leadership booklet to guide
their learning and reflection, which they can continue to refer to even
after the programme.</p>

<p>For many Primary 3 students, this is their first formal leadership experience,
a starting point that helps them recognise their strengths, appreciate
the value of teamwork, and take that first step towards leading with purpose.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Primary 4 Cohort Leadership Programme</strong></h4>
<p>Building on the foundation laid in Primary 3, the Primary 4 Cohort Leadership
Programme takes students deeper into the heart of leadership. This level
focuses on self-motivation, resilience, and goal-setting, helping students
take greater ownership of their actions and growth.</p>

<p>Through scenario-based challenges, interactive workshops, and structured
reflection, students explore what it means to stay focused in the face
of challenges, bounce back from setbacks, and persevere towards their goals.
The sessions also provide space for students to think about the kind of
leader they want to become and how they can lead with empathy and integrity.</p>

<p>The programme continues to align closely with our school’s ASPIRE values
and 21st Century Competencies (21CC), offering students a clear progression
in skills and values. Training materials such as student booklets and activity
guides are provided to support their learning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>More than just a workshop, the P4 programme is a platform for students
to realise that leadership isn’t about position, it’s about character.
Through this experience, they begin to see that the way they act, respond,
and influence others matters.</p>
