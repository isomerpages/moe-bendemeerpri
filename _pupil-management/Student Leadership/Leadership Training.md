<h3>LEADERSHIP TRAINING</h3>
<p>Bendemeer Primary firmly believes in providing a platform for the development
of leadership skills to better prepare students for the globalized world.
We conduct trainings for the different leadership tiers, starting by anchoring
the foundation in self-leadership and building their team leadership competencies
as they progress through the levels.</p>
<p>Our school-based leadership training is conducted per semester and every
student is exposed to the responsibilities and roles that they are involved
in their daily classroom activities.</p>
<p>The school also conducts cohort leadership trainings for Primary 3 and
Primary 4 pupils. During these trainings, students are given the opportunity
to develop and practice 21st-century skills. They learn and develop their
leadership skills by learning to cooperate and communicate with fellow
students through fun and engaging activities. These trainings focus on
three levels of the student’s development: as a leader, team builder, and
communicator.</p>

<p>Throughout the duration of the training, students worked in groups. As
they interact with their classmates, they learn to balance their social
and emotional competencies and identify their strengths and weaknesses.
Students were also taught social awareness by comprehending the importance
of making responsible decisions and the role of a team leader.</p>
