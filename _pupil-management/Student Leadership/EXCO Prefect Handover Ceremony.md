<h4><strong>EXCO Prefect Handover Ceremony - Communicate to Lead, Connect to Inspire</strong></h4>
<p>This year’s EXCO Prefect Handover Ceremony marked a meaningful transition
in our student leadership journey at Bendemeer Primary School. With the
theme “Communicate to Lead, Connect to Inspire” guiding our leadership
focus, the ceremony honoured both our outgoing and incoming EXCO Prefects,
celebrating their commitment to service and the continued growth of student
voice in our school.</p>

<p>Our P6 EXCO team took to the stage one last time, having led with integrity,
dedication, and heart throughout their term. As they symbolically passed
the Star Torch to their P5 juniors, it represented more than just a handover,
it was a gesture of mentorship, encouragement, and belief in the next generation
of leaders. The star-shaped torch served as a reminder that each leader
has the potential to be a light for others.</p>

<p>This year’s handover also featured a proud entrance by the newly appointed
P5 EXCO Prefects, introduced to the school community as they begin their
leadership journey. Selected through a rigorous process, these student
leaders were chosen not only for their strengths, but also for their willingness
to serve and grow.</p>

<p>As part of the ceremony, the launch of the Head Prefect Election 2025
was also announced. All students from Primary 3 to 6 will soon have the
opportunity to cast their vote, reinforcing our belief that student voice
matters in shaping the kind of leaders we wish to nurture.</p>

<p>The EXCO Prefect Handover Ceremony continues to be a powerful reminder
that leadership is a shared journey, to build on trust, communication,
and connection across generations of student leaders.</p>
