### TIER 2 STUDENT LEADERSHIP TRAINING

Bendemeer Primary firmly believes in providing a platform in the development of our student leaders. The Tier 2 student leadership training aims to allow our fellow student leaders to learn and develop their leadership skills by allowing them to cooperate and communicate with fellow student leaders through fun and engaging activities.Â 

These authentic learning experiences will definitely leave a deep impact in the students as they continue in their student leadership journey.
