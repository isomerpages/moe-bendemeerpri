<h3><strong>Celebrating Community Through Festive Outreach</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>At Bendemeer Primary School, we believe that meaningful connections with
our community help build a strong and gracious school culture. Our Festive
Community Outreach Programme is a key initiative that celebrates this belief
by fostering partnerships beyond the classroom.</p>

<p>Each year, during Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, and Deepavali, our
students, staff, and school leaders step out into the neighbourhood to
spread festive cheer to the shop owners and businesses that form part of
our wider school community. These visits serve as heartfelt gestures of
appreciation and unity.</p>

<p>As part of this outreach, our students design and craft unique, handmade
gifts that are presented to these community partners. These thoughtful
creations represent not only the joy of the festive season but also our
studentsâ€™ gratitude for the ongoing support and kindness shown by our neighbours.</p>

<p>Through this annual tradition, our students learn the importance of community
spirit, cultural appreciation, and giving back, reinforcing our commitment
to nurturing partnerships that matter.</p>
