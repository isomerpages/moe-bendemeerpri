<h4><strong>Head Prefect Election 2024 - Shaping Our Leaders</strong></h4>
<p>The annual Head Prefect Election is a significant event at Bendemeer Primary
School, where we focus on shaping a leader who will guide and inspire our
student body. This process not only fosters leadership skills among students
but also promotes active engagement within our school community. The Head
Prefect, along with other student leaders, are entrusted with important
responsibilities such as:</p>

<p>This year, the journey to shaping our new Head Prefect began with the
2023/2024 EXCO Prefect Handover Ceremony on 29 July 2024. Following this,
three candidates were introduced to the school, each delivering heartfelt
speeches outlining their goals and vision if elected.</p>

<p>The candidates then engaged with their peers during recess over two days,
running creative canvassing campaigns to earn the votes of their fellow
schoolmates.</p>
