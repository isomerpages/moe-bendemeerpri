<h4><strong>Head Prefect Election 2025 - Shaping Our Leaders</strong></h4>
<p>At Bendemeer Primary School, the Head Prefect Election is a meaningful
tradition that reflects our belief in nurturing student voices and growing
leaders from within. This annual process gives our students a chance to
reflect on the kind of leadership they value, and empowers them to play
a part in shaping the future of our student community.</p>

<p>Following their speeches, the campaign trail continued into recess time,
where each candidate and their team ran creative canvassing booths at the
school foyer. Students and staff were invited to engage with the candidates,
ask questions, and understand their values before voting.</p>

<p>Voting took place on Student Learning Space (SLS) and was open to all
students from Primary 3 to 6. Every student had one vote to cast, and they
were reminded to vote wisely and keep their choice confidential.</p>
<p>After the enthusiastic participation, the votes were cast, and the results
were eagerly awaited. Finally, on 4 August 2025, we proudly announced that
Srika Sivasankaran of class P5 Empathy had been elected as the new Head
Prefect for 2025.</p>
