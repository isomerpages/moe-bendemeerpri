<h3>Prefects Spreading Environmental Awareness Through Poster Campaigns</h3>
<p>Our P6 Prefects, in collaboration with the Media and Environment Club,
have taken a proactive role in promoting sustainability through a creative
poster campaign. Timed around Earth Day, this initiative focuses on upcycling
and recycling, with the prefects designing posters that advocate for these
eco-friendly practices.</p>

<p>In addition to being displayed throughout the school, these posters are
also featured as part of the Jalan Besar Town Councilâ€™s Eco-Themed Artwork
Initiative. The artwork is proudly displayed at Blk 68 Geylang Bahru, extending
the impact of our students' efforts beyond the school community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These posters serve as daily reminders of our collective responsibility
for environmental stewardship. Through this project, our P6 Prefects inspire
their peers and the broader community to embrace sustainable habits and
contribute to a greener future, exemplifying their leadership and commitment
to positive change.</p>
