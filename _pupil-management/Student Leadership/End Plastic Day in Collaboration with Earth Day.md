<h3>Prefects Spreading Environmental Awareness Through Poster Campaigns</h3>
<p>The P6 Prefects, in collaboration with the Media and Environment Club,
take an active role in promoting sustainability efforts, particularly during
events like Earth Day. As part of this collaboration, they channel their
creative energy into designing posters that advocate for upcycling and
recycling, amplifying the message of environmental consciousness throughout
the school community.</p>

<p>As the posters adorn the school walls, they serve as constant reminders
of the collective commitment to environmental stewardship. Through collaboration
and action, these student leaders inspire their peers to embrace sustainable
practices and work towards a greener future for generations to come.</p>
