<h3><strong>P5 Public Speaking Programme - Nurturing Confident Communicators</strong></h3>
<p>This year, the P5 Public Speaking Programme returned with even greater
energy and purpose. Due to overwhelming interest and strong demand, the
intake was doubled since last year, allowing more of our specialised student
leaders (i.e. Prefects, NE Champs, Lead Librarians, Peer Support Leaders,
Cyber Wellness Ambassadors, and Sports Leaders) to benefit from this enriching
opportunity.</p>

<p>The expanded cohort participated in a dynamic series of workshops designed
to build essential public speaking skills. From crafting compelling speeches
to refining body language and articulation, students explored a mix of
drama-based activities, speech delivery techniques, and real-world speaking
scenarios.</p>

<p>The highlight of the programme was the showcase segment, where each student
leader had the chance to present confidently in front of their peers. It
was inspiring to witness their transformation into poised speakers, ready
to advocate, inspire, and lead in their various leadership roles.</p>

<p>With more students now equipped with the power to speak with clarity and
confidence, weâ€™re proud to see our leadership community growing stronger
and more empowered to make a meaningful impact within the school and beyond.</p>
