<h3><strong>P5 Public Speaking Programme - Supporting Our Leaders</strong></h3>
<p>In our continuous effort to support the growth and development of our
student leaders, in January we held Public Speaking Programme for our student
leaders. These leaders encompass roles such as Prefects, NE Champs, Lead
Librarians, Peer Support Leaders, Cyber Wellness Ambassadors, and Sports
Leaders. The program was designed to enhance their communication skills,
combining engaging drama activities with essential public speaking tips.</p>

<p>The student leaders were led through a series of workshops that emphasized
speech preparation, mastery of body language, and articulation exercises,
among other essential public speaking skills. By engaging in role-playing
activities and sharing of stories, our students had the opportunity to
practice speaking in real-life scenarios, effectively translating lessons
into tangible skills.</p>

<p>The highlight of the program was when each student leader was tasked to
present in front of their peers, showcasing the skills they had learned.
Witnessing their transformation into confident and articulate speakers,
ready to take charge at school events, was just remarkable.</p>

skills!</p>
