### GOOD DEED PROJEC TBY P4 JUNIOR PREFECTS

  
The P4 junior prefects worked on the ‘Good Deed Project’ where students are strongly encouraged to practice responsibility and instil self-discipline of their own belongings.

Colourful posters were designed by these prefects and displayed around the school to serve as a reminder. The prefects also reinforced the value of integrity where the students are encouraged to give any lost and found items to the office.
