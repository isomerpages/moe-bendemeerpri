### End Plastic Day in Collaboration with Earth Day

**P6 Senior Prefects and EXCO Team**  
  
On 22nd April 2021, Bendemeer Primary School commemorated our very first “Zero Plastic Day” It was a collaboration project between the Prefects, ICT Ambassadors and the Environmental Ambassadors. The canteen vendors also came onboard this project proactively by using brown papers instead of plastic bags. The originator of this project was none other than our very own Head Prefect, Chin Si Hao (P6 Self-Discipline) who proposed this idea during his Canvassing Campaign Speech in 2020.

On this day, the use of any plastic disposables were forbidden and students were encouraged to bring along their own containers. The P6 senior prefects designed and displayed variety of meaningful posters to create awareness on how to save the earth. A pop-up booth was also set up in the foyer by the P6 EXCO team to educate the rest of the student population on various ways to reduce their usage on plastic products. They also designed productive products using upcycling product and online quiz to further test the students’ understanding.
