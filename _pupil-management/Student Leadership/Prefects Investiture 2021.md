### PREFECTS INVESTITURE 2021

Bendemeer Primary School’s Prefectorial Board held the Prefects’ Investiture Ceremony on the 22nd February 2021.  The entire event was pre-recorded and was played to the entire school population during one of the assembly period. This is an annual ceremony where we come together to formally officiate and congratulate the appointments of our P3 to P6 prefects and our EXCO 2021.

  

The Prefectorial Board is part of the Student Leadership Body and they exhibit our school values ASPIRE through their daily school duties.   During the Ceremony, our Head Prefect, Chin Si Hao (P6 Self-Discipline) led the newly appointed Exco Prefects in reciting the Prefect’s Oath, reaffirming their commitment towards leading and serving the school with pride.

  

Each of the EXCO Prefect invited a teacher who had impacted and inspired them to the investiture by giving them the honour to place the EXCO Prefect tie pin on their ties. In return, the EXCO Prefects expressed their gratitude for their teachers by presenting them with a stalk of pink rose and a ‘Thank You’ card.
