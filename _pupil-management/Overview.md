<h3>PUPIL MANAGEMENT</h3>
<h5>Overview<br></h5>
<p>The Pupil Management Department is committed to cultivating a positive
education culture that promotes well-being, resilience, and happiness among
our students. We believe that a safe, supportive, and positive learning
environment is crucial for students to achieve academic success and personal
growth. Our team integrates positive education principles into our counselling
and behaviour management practices, emphasizing the importance of character
strengths, positive relationships, and mindfulness.</p>
<p>We prioritize the social and emotional development of our students, and
our department works tirelessly to ensure that each student feels valued,
respected, and supported throughout their journey in BPS.</p>
<h3>School-based Key Programmes<br></h3>
<h4>Pastoral Care in BPS</h4>
<p>At BPS, prioritising student well-being is foundational. We firmly believe
that a positive and supportive learning environment is essential for a
comprehensive educational experience. Through cultivating resilient teacher-student
relationships and strong partnerships with parents, we foster the holistic
growth of our students. As students progress through different phases of
their primary school journey, it's crucial for educators and parents to
equip themselves with essential skills to address challenges effectively.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Pastoral Team in BPS aims to provide interventions that extend beyond
managing current situations. Their focus is on empowering students to emerge
as resilient individuals, adaptable and with a spirit of empathy. Aligned
with our dedication to positive education, our interventions emphasize
cultivating a positive mindset, building character strengths, and promoting
overall well-being.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Furthermore, our School Counsellors proactively engage in stress management
talks to provide students with valuable tools to navigate the challenges
they may encounter. This approach not only addresses immediate concerns
but also equips students with skills that will serve them well throughout
their academic journey and into the future.</p>
<h5>Assembly talks</h5>
<p>The department promotes positive school culture and the well-being of
our students through regular talks that emphasize positive behaviour, respect,
and accountability. We integrate positive education principles into our
talks to help students develop essential skills such as mindfulness and
positive relationships. Our goal is to provide a safe and inclusive learning
environment that supports academic success and personal growth.</p>
<h5>Induction for new students</h5>
<p>An induction programme is provided for every new student who comes to
our school at any time of the year. The school Administrative Manager,
School Counsellor and Form Teacher together with the new student and his/her
buddy will be involved in this programme. This programme ensures that every
new student feel welcomed to the school and his/her needs are being looked
into.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provision of support for students with emotional / behaviour / financial
needs</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preventive Education

Drug Abuse/Smoking/Vaping and promote cyber wellness/social interaction.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students with
special needs and emotional/behavioural needs are referred to our Special
Needs Officer/or School Counsellor for guidance and support.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Financial assistance
is provided for needy students.</p>
<p>Model class award</p>
<p>The termly model class award program was introduced to recognize and reward
classes that demonstrate outstanding behaviour and positive attitude. We
believe that this initiative fosters a positive school culture and encourages
essential skills such as resilience and teamwork. We encourage all our
classes to strive for excellence and promote a supportive learning environment.</p>
<h5>Bi-annual Police Talk (by Rochor NPC)</h5>
<p>On a bi-annual basis, the department partners with the police (Rochor
NPC) to conduct talks for our students. These talks aim to promote safety
and raise awareness of important issues among our students. The talks cover
a range of topics such as road safety, cyber safety, crime prevention and
drug abuse. Through these talks, our students learn essential safety skills
and gain knowledge that can help them make informed decisions in their
daily lives.</p>
<p>Our partnership with the police helps to foster a positive relationship
between our students and the police, which is important for promoting safety
in our community. The talks also align with our positive education principles,
as they help students develop character strengths such as responsibility
and awareness.</p>

<h5>Stop, Think, Do Model</h5>
<p>In BPS, we believe in taking a proactive approach to behaviour management
that is rooted in positive education principles. That's why we have adopted
the Stop Think Do model as a key strategy for promoting positive behaviour
among our students.</p>
<p>The Stop Think Do model is a positive behaviour management approach that
emphasizes the importance of self-regulation, problem-solving, and responsible
decision-making. By teaching our students to stop and think before reacting,
we are helping them develop the skills they need to manage their emotions
and behaviour in a positive way.</p>
<p>Through the use of the Stop Think Do model, our students are learning
to regulate their behaviour, take responsibility for their actions, and
make positive choices in challenging situations. In addition to its effectiveness
in behaviour management, the Stop Think Do model is also grounded in positive
education principles. It promotes a growth mindset, encourages students
to take ownership of their learning, and helps to develop their resilience
and social-emotional skills.</p>
