### PUPIL MANAGEMENT

In Bendemeer, we believe in providing a caring and conducive learning environment for our pupils where they enjoy learning, where they are given affirmation and encouragement, where they feel confident of themselves and give their best. We provide them with opportunities through various programmes: 

  

**School-based Key Programmes** <br>
**Assembly Talks** <br>
Weekly Assembly Talks are conducted by School Leaders, Staff and Partners on safety aspects, environment issues, healthy lifestyle and personal well-being.  

**Weekly Story-telling** <br>
Teachers conduct weekly story-telling on Character and Citizenship. Pupils are exposed to a wide genre from fictional to non-fictional and also learn more about the history of Singapore. Values are taught as the stories unfold.  

**Experiential Week** <br>
Experiential Week is conducted for P1-6 pupils which includes, Motivational Talks by SAC Members and Ex-students, learning journeys and integrated lessons across departments. The Experiential Week package also includes aspects of character development where pupils take part in activities to develop their character.  

**Induction Programme for New Pupils** <br>
An induction programme is provided for every new pupil who comes to our school at any time of the year. The school Administrative Manager, School Counsellor and Form Teacher together with the new pupil and his buddy will be involved in this programme. This programme ensures that every new pupil feels welcomed to the school and his needs are being looked into.
