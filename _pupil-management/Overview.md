<h3>PUPIL MANAGEMENT</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The Pupil Management Department is committed to cultivating a positive
education culture that promotes well-being, resilience and happiness among
our students. We believe that a safe, supportive and positive learning
environment is crucial for students to achieve both academic success and
personal growth.</p>
<p>Our team integrates positive education principles into our counselling
and behaviour management practices, emphasising the development of character
strengths, positive relationships and mindfulness. We prioritise the social
and emotional development of our students and work closely with key stakeholders
to ensure that every student feels valued, respected and supported throughout
their journey in BPS.</p>
<h3>School-based Key Programmes</h3>
<h4>Pastoral Care in BPS</h4>
<p>At BPS, prioritising student well-being is foundational. We firmly believe
that a positive and supportive learning environment is essential for a
holistic educational experience. Through cultivating strong teacher-student
relationships and meaningful partnerships with parents, we foster the holistic
development of our students.</p>
<p>As students progress through different phases of their primary school
journey, educators and parents are equipped with essential skills and strategies
to address challenges effectively.</p>
<p>The Pastoral Team in BPS provides interventions that go beyond managing
immediate concerns. Our focus is on empowering students to develop resilience,
adaptability and empathy. Aligned with our commitment to positive education,
these interventions emphasise building a positive mindset, strengthening
character strengths and promoting overall well-being.</p>
<p>In addition, our School Counsellors proactively reach out to students
during recess, and conduct stress management talks and group sessions to
equip them with practical tools to cope with academic and social demands.
This holistic approach supports students in the present and empowers them
with valuable life skills for the future.</p>
<h4>Assembly talks</h4>
<p>The department promotes a positive school culture and student well-being
through regular assembly talks that emphasise positive behaviour, respect
and accountability. Positive education principles are integrated into these
sessions to help students develop essential life skills such as mindfulness,
empathy and building positive relationships.</p>
<p>Our aim is to foster a safe and inclusive learning environment that supports
both academic excellence and character development.</p>
<h4>Induction Programme for New Students</h4>
<p>An induction programme is provided for every new student who joins the
school at any point during the year. The programme involves the School
Administrative Manager, School Counsellor, Form Teacher, the new student
and a peer buddy.</p>
<p>This structured programme ensures that every new student feels welcomed,
supported and well-integrated into the school environment, with their academic
and social-emotional needs carefully monitored.</p>
<h4>Provision of Support for Students with Emotional, Behavioural and Financial Needs</h4>
<p>The department adopts a multi-tiered approach to support students’ well-being:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Preventive education through assembly talks to raise awareness of issues
such as drug abuse, smoking, vaping, cyber wellness and healthy social
interactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students with additional needs and those with emotional or behavioural
concerns are referred to the Special Educational Needs Officer (SENO) and/or
School Counsellor for targeted guidance and intervention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial assistance schemes are made available to support students from
financially disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Model Class Award</h4>
<p>The termly Model Class Award was introduced to recognise and affirm classes
that demonstrate exemplary behaviour and positive attitudes. This initiative
fosters a positive school culture and encourages the development of key
competencies such as resilience, teamwork and responsibility.</p>
<p>Through this programme, students are motivated to take collective ownership
of their behaviour and contribute to a supportive learning environment.</p>
<h4>Bi-annual Police Talk (Rochor NPC)</h4>
<p>On a bi-annual basis, the department partners Rochor Neighbourhood Police
Centre (NPC) to conduct safety and awareness talks for students. These
sessions cover topics such as road safety, cyber safety, crime prevention
and drug abuse.</p>
<p>Through these engagements, students acquire essential safety knowledge
and develop informed decision-making skills. The partnership also helps
foster positive relationships between students and the police, reinforcing
community safety and social responsibility.</p>

<h5>Stop, Think, Do Model</h5>
<p>In BPS, we adopt a proactive and restorative approach to behaviour management
grounded in positive education principles. The Stop, Think, Do model serves
as a key framework to promote positive behaviour among students.</p>
<p>This model emphasises self-regulation, problem-solving and responsible
decision-making. By teaching students to pause and reflect before reacting,
they learn to manage emotions constructively and respond to challenges
appropriately.</p>
<p>Through consistent application of the Stop, Think, Do model, students
develop accountability, self-awareness and resilience. The approach supports
the development of a growth mindset and strengthens students’ social-emotional
competencies, enabling them to make positive choices both in and beyond
the classroom.</p>
