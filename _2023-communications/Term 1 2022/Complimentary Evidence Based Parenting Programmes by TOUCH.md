### COMPLIMENTARY EVIDENCE-BASED PARENTING PROGRAMMES BY TOUCH
***13 Jan 2022***

Dear Parents and Guardians,

We are happy to inform you that TOUCH Parenting (a service of TOUCH Community Services) will continue to be our school’s MSF (Ministry of Social and Family Development) – appointed Parenting Support Provider (PSP) in 2022.  Through TOUCH, you will be able to gain access to fully funded evidence-based parenting programmes where, through rigorous research, parenting principles and strategies have been shown to work.

To help TOUCH better understand your parenting needs and preferences, please click through the following link to fill in a quick survey; they will follow up with you thereafter based on your inputs. The link to the survey is [http://bit.ly/tppnps](http://bit.ly/tppnps).

TOUCH has created a short video introduction to help parents understand the programmes better and to help debunk certain myths surrounding them (i.e. only parents with parenting issues should attend, etc.). The video can be accessed at [https://youtu.be/9d0Q1lwiAPc](https://youtu.be/9d0Q1lwiAPc); it is also viewable within the survey mentioned above.

For the Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P) Mass level seminars, TOUCH will confirm the dates of the sessions at a later date.

Registration for the Triple P One-to-One consultations is ongoing via the same survey link above; information on the programme will be provided on the second page of the survey.

For more information on the parenting services provided by TOUCH and their contact details, you can access their website at [http://www.touch.org.sg/parenting](http://www.touch.org.sg/parenting).

We are glad to be working closely with TOUCH in providing parenting support to you in 2022, and we look forward to your active participation in fully utilising these parenting resources made available for you.

Thank you.
