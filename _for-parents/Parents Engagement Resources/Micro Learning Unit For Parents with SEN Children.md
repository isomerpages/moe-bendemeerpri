### MICRO LEARNING UNIT FOR PARENTS WITH SEN CHILDREN

Dear Parents  
  

These micro-learning units aim to: <br>
1\. To empower and equip you with strategies on learning and behavioural aspects which have been proven to work according to research. <br>
2\. To provide an additional platform for home-school collaboration.

We hope that the evidence-based strategies that you have learnt will help you to support your child at home.

Thank you.
