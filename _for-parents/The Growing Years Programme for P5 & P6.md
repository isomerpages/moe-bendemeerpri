<h4>MOE SEXUALITY EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS</h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with
members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions
on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as
the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Goals </strong>of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a) Support students in managing their physiological, social and emotional
changes as they grow up and develop safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>(b) Guide students to make wise, informed and responsible decisions on
sexuality matters.</p>
<p>(c) Help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and
others by having positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality
that are premised on the family as the basic unit society.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Key Messages</strong> of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a) Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b) Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are
the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>(c) Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society;
and</p>
<p>(d) Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV
and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved
ones.

<h4>OVERVIEW OF BENDEMEER PRIMARY SCHOOL'S SEXUALITY EDUCATION PROGRAMME FOR 2026 &nbsp;</h4>
<p>4. Sexuality Education is delivered in a holistic manner through the school
curriculum. The content for Sexuality Education is grouped into five main
themes: Human Development, Interpersonal Relationships, Sexual Health,
Sexual Behaviour, and, Culture, Society and Law. You may click&nbsp;
<a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-sexuality-education-scope" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;for more information on the scope of Sexuality Education
in the school curriculum.
<br>
<br>
<br>5. The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include:
<br>a. Science
<br>b. Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
<h5><u>Sexuality Education Lessons: </u><br></h5>
<p>6. The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition
and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a younger age
and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological changes
in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming biologically
ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having the corresponding
cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours. Furthermore,
our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences that could endanger
health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our students require
guidance so that they can respond with discernment to the sexual messages
in the media and other sources.
<br>
<br>7. Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP)
at Primary 5 and 6. Through these lessons, students will learn healthy
ways to manage the physiological, social and emotional changes in their
growing years. They learn to build healthy and rewarding relationships
with others, including those with members of the opposite sex. Students
are also guided to make wise, informed and responsible decisions to keep
themselves safe from sexually-related risks.
