### POSITIVE PARENTING PROGRAMME (TRIPLE P) LEVEL 2 SEMINAR RUNS

Dear Parents  
 

Our Parenting Support Provider (PSP), TOUCH Community Services, is organising Triple P Selected Seminar Series for all parents at Bendemeer Primary School via Zoom.  

It is an evidence-based and research-backed parenting and family support strategy that has been proven to enhance the knowledge, skills and confidence of parents, as well as reduce parenting-related stress. It is suitable for all parents, be it for those looking to resolve certain behavioural issues in their teenager or for those wishing to level up a notch in their parenting.

More information can be found in the attached e-flyer. You are strongly encouraged to attend all 3 seminars to get the most benefit from the programme, which has been fully subsidised for you by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)
