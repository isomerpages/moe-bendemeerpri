### POSITIVE PARENTING PROGRAMMES

We are pleased to inform you that the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) has informed the school that TOUCH Community Services will continue as our MSF-appointed Parenting Support Provider in 2022. Through TOUCH, parents will be able to gain access to fully funded evidence-based parenting programmes - ‘***Triple P’ (Positive Parenting Programmes)***.

##### What is Triple P (Positive Parenting Programmes)?

The **_Triple P_** is one of the most effective evidence-based parenting programmes in the world, backed up by more than 30 years of ongoing research.  **_Triple P_** gives parents simple and practical strategies to help them build strong, healthy relationships, confidently manage their children's behaviour and prevent problems from developing.

##### How can Triple P help in parenting?

**_Triple P_** helps parents to raise happy and confident kids by:

·        Managing misbehaviour so that everyone in the family enjoys life more;

·        Setting rules and routines that everyone respects and follows;

·        Taking care of yourself as a parent; and

·        Feeling confident you are doing the right thing.

Our school is glad to be working closely with TOUCH in providing parenting support to parents in 2021. We also look forward to your active participation in fully utilising these parenting resources made available for you.
