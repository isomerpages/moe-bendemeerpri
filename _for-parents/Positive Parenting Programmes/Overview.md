<h3>POSITIVE PARENTING PROGRAMMES</h3>
<p>We are pleased to inform you that the Ministry of Social and Family Development
(MSF) has informed the school that TOUCH Community Services will continue
as our MSF-appointed Parenting Support Provider in 2022. Through TOUCH,
parents will be able to gain access to fully funded evidence-based parenting
programmes - ‘<strong><em>Triple P’&nbsp;(Positive&nbsp;Parenting&nbsp;Programmes)</em></strong>.</p>
<h5>What is Triple P (Positive Parenting Programmes)?</h5>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong><em>Triple P</em></strong>&nbsp;is one of the most effective
evidence-based parenting programmes in the world, backed up by more than
30 years of ongoing research.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>Triple P</em></strong>&nbsp;gives
parents simple and practical strategies to help them build strong, healthy
relationships, confidently manage their children's behaviour and prevent
problems from developing.</p>
<h5>How can Triple P help in parenting?</h5>
<p><strong><em>Triple P</em></strong>&nbsp;helps parents to raise happy and
confident kids by:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Managing misbehaviour
so that everyone in the family enjoys life more;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting rules and routines
that everyone respects and follows;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking care of yourself
as a parent; and</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeling confident you
are doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Our school is glad to be working closely with TOUCH in providing parenting
support to parents in 2021. We also look forward to your active participation
