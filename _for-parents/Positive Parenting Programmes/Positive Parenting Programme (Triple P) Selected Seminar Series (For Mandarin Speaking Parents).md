### POSITIVE PARENTING PROGRAMME (TRIPLE P) SELECTED SEMINAR SERIES (FOR MANDARIN SPEAKING PARENTS)

Dear Parent/ Guardian,

Our Parenting Support Provider (PSP), TOUCH Community Services, is organising **Triple P Selected Seminar Series (Mandarin)** for all parents at **Bendemeer Primary School** via Zoom.

It is an evidence-based and research-backed parenting and family support strategy that has been proven to enhance the knowledge, skills and confidence of parents, as well as reduce parenting-related stress. It is suitable for all parents, be it for those looking to resolve certain behavioural issues in their teenager or for those wishing to level up a notch in their parenting.

More information can be found in the attached e-flyer. You are strongly encouraged to attend all 3 seminars to get the most benefit from the programme, which has been fully subsidised for you by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF).
