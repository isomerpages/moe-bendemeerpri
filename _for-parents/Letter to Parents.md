<h3><strong>2026 Letters to parents</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Welcome to Bendemeer Primary School’s Letters to Parents.</strong>
<br>This page brings together all official letters and key communications
shared with parents and guardians throughout the year. Through these updates,
we aim to keep you informed about school programmes, events, learning activities,
and important administrative matters. Parents are encouraged to refer to

so that we can continue working closely together to support our students’
learning, well-being, and growth at BPS.</p>
