<p><strong>Administering of Medicine</strong>
</p>
<p>If the student requires the use of daily medication (e.g. inhalers for
asthma), parents are to ensure that the student knows how to consume the
medicine, or use the devices, and carries them with him / her daily.&nbsp;
&nbsp;Please keep the teachers informed of your childâ€™s condition as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We seek your understanding that school staff are not authorised to administer
any medication to students.&nbsp;</p>
