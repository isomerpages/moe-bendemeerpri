Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB)
-----------------------------------

Full SBB is part of MOEâ€™s ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.

Full SBB was implemented in 28 secondary schools from 2020. It is being progressively rolled out to more secondary schools each year from 2022 to 2024.
