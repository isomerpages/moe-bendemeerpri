New PSLE Scoring System
-----------------------

The revised PSLE scoring system will help your child focus on their learning instead of how they compare to others.

The PSLE is a useful checkpoint to gauge your childâ€™s understanding of key concepts and academic strengths. This will help your child learn at a suitable pace when they progress to secondary school.  
  
Changes made to the PSLE scoring system from 2021 will reflect your child's level of achievement through scoring bands.
