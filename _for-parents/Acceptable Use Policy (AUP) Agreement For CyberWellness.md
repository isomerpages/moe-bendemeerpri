<h4><strong>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) for Cyber Wellness</strong></h4>
<p>At Bendemeer Primary School, we are committed to providing a safe, respectful,
and supportive digital learning environment for all students. The Acceptable
Use Policy (AUP) sets out clear guidelines to support the responsible and
appropriate use of school-provided digital devices and online resources
for learning.</p>
<p>Through the AUP, students are guided to develop positive cyber habits,
safeguard their personal information, respect others in online spaces,
and make informed and responsible choices when using technology. We appreciate
the partnership of parents in reinforcing these expectations at home, as
we work together to nurture cyber-aware and responsible digital citizens.</p>
<p>The Acceptable Use Policy can be found on <strong>page 48 of the Student Handbook</strong> for
your reference.</p>
