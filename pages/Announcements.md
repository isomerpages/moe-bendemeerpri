<h3>Announcements</h3>
<p>Dear BPS Alumni,
<br>
<br>We are on a mission to reconnect and stay in touch with each and every
one of you!
<br>Bendemeer Primary School is eager to hear about your journeys since your
time with us.
<br>Whether you're living abroad, rocking your career, or hitting the books,
we are all ears!
<br>Because, once a Bendemeer student, always part of the family!
<br>
<br>Here is what we would love to know from you:
<br>1) Your full Name
<br>2) Year of Graduation
<br>3) What is keeping you busy these days? Work, studies, or something exciting!
<br>4) Contact number
<br>5) Share a recent photo where you're shining bright like a Bendemeer star!</p>

<br>Calling out especially to those who walked our halls from 1977 onwards,
including our buddies from Balestier Hill Primary School post-2019 merger.
And if you were part of the crew between 1990 and 2000, you're in our spotlight!
<br>
<br>Rest assured, the information and pics are just between us and will be
showcased at our special school events. It's our way of showing off how
far our Bendemeer fam has come!
<br>
<br>Looking forward to catching up and reminiscing about the good times!
<br>
