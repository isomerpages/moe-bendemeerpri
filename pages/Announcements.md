<p>Calling all ex-BPS students and parents! 🎓✨</p>
<p>Teachers' Day 2025 is just around the corner, and we have a special way
to show our appreciation for the educators who made a lasting impact on
you or your child's journey at Bendemeer Primary School.</p>
<p>🖋️ Let's take a moment to reminisce and pen down some heartfelt thoughts
for our former teachers. Whether it's a favorite memory, a valuable lesson
learned, or simply a thank-you note, your words will mean the world to
them. 💕</p>
<p>🗓️ Please share your messages with us by 29 August 2025, so we can compile
all your beautiful messages and present them to our beloved teachers on
their special day!</p>
