A wide variety of after-school programmes are organised to cater to the different needs of individual students. In a summary, the school looked at four aspects of development in our students. They are: <br>
1\.	Cognitive <br>
2\.	Socio-Emotional<br>
3\.	Physical <br>
4\.	Aesthetic 

For cognitive development, KidsREAD programme aims to build good reading habits in our lower primary students and build up their vocabulary. Heartware Tuition for upper primary students provides a platform for the upper primary students with regards to any subject concepts they are unsure about and build on their readiness for the upcoming PSLE.
For Socio-Emotional development, NURTURE programme organised by the CDC aims to cultivate confidence in the students. They also learn the importance of effective communication and problem solving skills. For the CARE Mentoring Programme, it aims to create opportunities for students to develop essential skills to meet their goals and take on challenge in school. At the same time, it provides a safe space for them to explore their strengths, developmental goals and forge prosocial relationships with their peers and teachers.
For physical development, the school organized the Fun with Sports Programme. This programme  allows students to learn self-discipline and communication skills through interactive games and sports activities.

Lastly for aesthetic development, students will participate in Artist-In-School that will provide them with opportunities to learn to explore the elements of play through image, objects, and audio visuals to represent self. At the same time, the students will also be onboard the Project Phoenix that allows students to learn English Proficiency through magic. All programmes aim to engage students meaningfully after school so that they will have a positive experience in school. Stay tuned for more updates!

The programme leverages on authentic learning experience to ignite the students’ sense of wonder and discovery of themselves as individuals, their peers and environment. It provides opportunities for our students to have greater access to the Arts beyond the classroom context.

Through the programme, the students also develop their Socio-emotional competencies and be more confident in expressing themselves through the Arts.
