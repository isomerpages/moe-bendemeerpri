<h3>IGNITE</h3>
<h5><strong><u>IGNITE Programme Interest Groups for Nurturing and Transforming Through Experiences</u></strong></h5>
<p>IGNITE aims to offer our P4 and P5 students workshops or courses that
they students can decide to take up based on their interest. The rationale
for this programme is to give our students autonomy in their learning.
When students are given opportunities to be independent, to be engaged
and to pursue their own interests, they will be more motivated. When students
have the ability to do that, they persist longer in the face of difficulties.
They show more initiative and curiosity as well as develop a greater sense
of confidence in their ability.</p>
<p>In Term 1, P5 supplementary is not conducted. Instead, the time is given
to the IGNITE programme. In Term 2, our P4s had the opportunity to participate
in the IGNITE programme. Teachers from Bendemeer were given the freedom
to come up with their own interest groups to be conducted during the time.
Some examples of the interest groups conducted are: Learning Japanese,
Football, Creative Science, Learning about Board Games, Fashion Design
and Videography.</p>
<p>In 2025, we were also able to benefit from collaborations with Bendemeer
Secondary, SAJC, CJC, Northlight and Raffles Institution.</p>
<p>Students were given the autonomy to choose which workshops they would
like to sign up for and can choose up to two workshops. The programme will
culminate in the students sharing what they have learnt from the programme.
Through this programme, we hope that our students find their X-factor and
are motivated to learn in school.</p>
