<h3>IGNITE</h3>
<h5><strong><u>Interest Groups for Nurturing and Transforming through Experiences</u></strong></h5>
<p>IGNITE aims to offer our P5 students workshops or courses that our P5
students can decide to take up based on their interest. The rationale for
this programme is to give our students autonomy in their learning. When
students are given opportunities to be independent, to be engaged and to
pursue their own interests, they will be more motivated. When students
have the ability to do that, they persist longer in the face of difficulties.
They show more initiative and curiosity as well as develop a greater sense
of confidence in their ability.</p>
<p>In Semester 1, P5 supplementary is not conducted. Instead, the time is
given to the IGNITE programme. Teachers from Bendemeer were given the freedom
to come up with their own interest groups to be conducted during the time.
Some examples of the interest groups conducted are: Debate, Learning Japanese,
Football, Inclusive Sports, Learning about Board Games, Fashion Design
and Videography.</p>
<p>This year we are also able to benefit from collaborations with SAJC, CJC,
Northlight and RI. Our students had the opportunity to attend a musical
appreciation workshop conducted by the SAJC concert band as well as a cooking
workshop conducted by Northlight. In Term 3, we are looking forward to
workshops related to STEM conducted by CJC and Water Polo conducted by
RI.</p>
<p>Students were given the autonomy to choose which workshops they would
like to sign up for and can choose up to two workshops. The programme will
culminate in the students sharing what they have learnt from the programme.
Through this programme, we hope that our students find their X-factor and
are motivated to learn in school.</p>

<h3><strong>IGNITE @ BENDEMEER SEMESTER 2 OF 2024</strong></h3>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In Semester 2, our students were treated a whole
host of programmes and&nbsp; activities conducted under the IGNITE Programme
and in collaboration with other schools. This would not have been possible
without the generosity of the following schools -- Northlight, St Andrews
Junior College, Catholic Junior College and Raffles Institution. Find out
about the fantastic activities they were involved in this past semester.</p>
<h4>Chef for a Day at Northlight School</h4>

<p>From 27-2 May, our P6 students participated in an Arduino Coding Workshop
organized by students of the STEM club in Catholic Junior College. The
students mastered the basics of coding and even programmed a car to successfully
navigate a track. Thank you CJC for your patience and enthusiasm in teaching
us Arduino Coding.</p>

<p>On Friday, 5 July our P6 students signed up to learn more about laser
cutting from the CJC STEM Club. They had so much fun unleashing their creativity
and even brought home a customized keychain or two!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sub>Reflection: </sub><em><sub>I enjoyed making the customized cards with our name. I learnt that I should always plan properly before I start work. Thank you CJC for making the workshop so fun and enjoyable.</sub></em>

<h4>Water Polo at Raffles Institution</h4>
<p>Twelve of our boys from Bendemeer Primary School participated in the Water
Polo programme conducted at Raffles Institution from 27 June to 25 July.
Most of them had never played the sport before and were enthusiastic about
the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of Water Polo through these sessions.</p>
<p>Through this programme, besides learning the fundamentals of Water Polo,
they were also given an opportunity to walk through the halls of RI. Our
students certainly benefitted from this experience. Let’s read some of
their reflections below.</p>

<p><em><sub>They taught me the basics of Water Polo so patiently. They made each session more enjoyable and I’m more interested in the sport than when I first started. I hope to be able to learn Water Polo even after this programme!</sub></em>
