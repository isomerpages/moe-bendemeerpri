<h3>IGNITE</h3>
<h5><strong><u>Interest Groups for Nurturing and Transforming through Experiences</u></strong></h5>
<p>IGNITE aims to offer our P5 students workshops or courses that our P5
students can decide to take up based on their interest. The rationale for
this programme is to give our students autonomy in their learning. When
students are given opportunities to be independent, to be engaged and to
pursue their own interests, they will be more motivated. When students
have the ability to do that, they persist longer in the face of difficulties.
They show more initiative and curiosity as well as develop a greater sense
of confidence in their ability.</p>
<p>In Semester 1, P5 supplementary is not conducted. Instead, the time is
given to the IGNITE programme. Teachers from Bendemeer were given the freedom
to come up with their own interest groups to be conducted during the time.
Some examples of the interest groups conducted are: Debate, Learning Japanese,
Football, Inclusive Sports, Learning about Board Games, Fashion Design
and Videography.</p>
<p>This year we are also able to benefit from collaborations with SAJC, CJC,
Northlight and RI. Our students had the opportunity to attend a musical
appreciation workshop conducted by the SAJC concert band as well as a cooking
workshop conducted by Northlight. In Term 3, we are looking forward to
workshops related to STEM conducted by CJC and Water Polo conducted by
RI.</p>
<p>Students were given the autonomy to choose which workshops they would
like to sign up for and can choose up to two workshops. The programme will
culminate in the students sharing what they have learnt from the programme.
Through this programme, we hope that our students find their X-factor and
are motivated to learn in school.</p>
