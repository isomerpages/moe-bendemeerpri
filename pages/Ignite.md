<h3>IGNITE</h3>
<h5><strong><u>IGNITE Programme Interest Groups for Nurturing and Transforming Through Experiences</u></strong></h5>
<p>IGNITE aims to offer our P4 and P5 students workshops or courses that
they students can decide to take up based on their interest. The rationale
for this programme is to give our students autonomy in their learning.
When students are given opportunities to be independent, to be engaged
and to pursue their own interests, they will be more motivated. When students
have the ability to do that, they persist longer in the face of difficulties.
They show more initiative and curiosity as well as develop a greater sense
of confidence in their ability.</p>
<p>In Term 1, P5 supplementary is not conducted. Instead, the time is given
to the IGNITE programme. In Term 2, our P4s had the opportunity to participate
in the IGNITE programme. Teachers from Bendemeer were given the freedom
to come up with their own interest groups to be conducted during the time.
Some examples of the interest groups conducted are: Learning Japanese,
Football, Creative Science, Learning about Board Games, Fashion Design
and Videography.</p>
<p>In 2025, we were also able to benefit from collaborations with Bendemeer
Secondary, SAJC, CJC, Northlight and Raffles Institution.</p>
<p>Students were given the autonomy to choose which workshops they would
like to sign up for and can choose up to two workshops. The programme will
culminate in the students sharing what they have learnt from the programme.
Through this programme, we hope that our students find their X-factor and
are motivated to learn in school.</p>

<h3><strong>IGNITE @ BENDEMEER SEMESTER 2 OF 2024</strong></h3>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In Semester 2, our students were treated a whole
host of programmes and&nbsp; activities conducted under the IGNITE Programme
and in collaboration with other schools. This would not have been possible
without the generosity of the following schools -- Northlight, St Andrews
Junior College, Catholic Junior College and Raffles Institution. Find out
about the fantastic activities they were involved in this past semester.</p>

<p>From 27-2 May, our P6 students participated in an Arduino Coding Workshop
organized by students of the STEM club in Catholic Junior College. The
students mastered the basics of coding and even programmed a car to successfully
navigate a track. Thank you CJC for your patience and enthusiasm in teaching
us Arduino Coding.</p>

and even brought home a customized keychain or two!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sub>Reflection: </sub><em><sub>I enjoyed making the customized cards with our name. I learnt that I should always plan properly before I start work. Thank you CJC for making the workshop so fun and enjoyable.</sub></em>

<h4>Water Polo at Raffles Institution</h4>
<p>Twelve of our boys from Bendemeer Primary School participated in the Water
Polo programme conducted at Raffles Institution from 27 June to 25 July.
Most of them had never played the sport before and were enthusiastic about
the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of Water Polo through these sessions.</p>
<p>Through this programme, besides learning the fundamentals of Water Polo,
they were also given an opportunity to walk through the halls of RI. Our
students certainly benefitted from this experience. Let’s read some of
their reflections below.</p>

<p><em><sub>They taught me the basics of Water Polo so patiently. They made each session more enjoyable and I’m more interested in the sport than when I first started. I hope to be able to learn Water Polo even after this programme!</sub></em>
