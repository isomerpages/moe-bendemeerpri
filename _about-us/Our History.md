### OUR HISTORY

#### School History & Background


Bendemeer Primary School started in 1977 and was officially opened by Mr Sidek Saniff, Member of Parliament for Kolam Ayer on March 1978. Under PRIME, the school merged with Beng Wan Primary School on Jan 2004. Balestier Hill Primary School was established in January 2002 following the merger of Moulmein Primary School and Swiss Cottage Primary School. The school was declared officially open on Nov 2004 by Minister of Health Mr Khaw Boon Wan. 

  

In 2019, Bendemeer Primary School and Balestier Hill Primary School merged to form the new Bendemeer Primary School. Our new mission is to nurture and inspire every student to be the best that they can be. The school will strive to give every student the best experience in their 6 years of primary school and to build their self-confidence and leadership qualities as they develop into young adults who will contribute to the nation.
