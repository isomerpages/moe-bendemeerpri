### SCHOOL MASCOT

**Launch of School Mascot**

Bendemeer Primary School proudly launched our school’s very own mascot – ‘Ben’ The Otter on 3rd February 2020. As Ben danced and made his grand entrance, students welcomed him by waving their mini otter flags excitedly. Our school adopted the otter to be the role model mascot due to their positive attributes and values such as teamwork, passion and resilience.

Prefects worked as a team to brainstorm a variety of names and presented to the school to get the students to vote for their favourite name for the mascot. The objective of launching a mascot is to create loyal supporters of our students, staff and parents as it will be a recognizable symbol of our school. It also represents the values every Bendemeer student should cultivate and exhibit from the otter’s family. 

Ben is now a new member who has joined our Bendemeer family and will always be part of our school’s future vital events.
