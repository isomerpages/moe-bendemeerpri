<p align="center"> <b> <u>MOE Kindergarten at Bendemeer Primary School</u> </b> </p>

We are pleased to inform you that MOE will be setting up an **MOE Kindergarten** (MK) within Bendemeer Primary School. The MK at Bendemeer Primary School will **enrol Kindergarten 1 (K1) children from January 2023** . The MOE Kindergarten registration exercise for 2023 K1 admission would be held in early 2022.

MOE has been running MKs since 2014 to provide ***A Strong Start for Every Child***. The MK Curriculum nurtures children holistically so that they are confident, demonstrate strong social skills and have a good foundation in literacy and numeracy.

The siting of an MK in our school will offer enriched learning experiences for the school community. Our students will develop social and interpersonal skills by participating in joint activities with the younger children. Our school teachers will also benefit from a mutual understanding of educational programmes in the MK and primary schools. Our school will be strongly supported by MOE HQ in the setting up of the MK. Please refer to the photos below for an illustration of the vibrant learning environment and age-appropriate facilities for MK.
