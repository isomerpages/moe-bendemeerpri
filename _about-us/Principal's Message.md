### PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE

**Mrs Tan-Lim Kim Gek’s Welcome Back to School Message 2022**

![Mrs Tan.jpg](/images/Mrs%20Tan.jpg)Warmest greetings to all! Welcome back to a brand new year.

This year’s focus is ‘Know me. Affirm me. Nurture me.’ Through this, we hope to understand the unique profile of each student better and cater more effectively to their needs. By affirming our students, we hope to build their confidence and in turn promote positive motivation for them to succeed and follow their dreams. We know our students of Bendemeer are worthy and capable of great things. We want our students to also be nurtured well and develop in themselves our ASPIRE values of Adaptability, Self-Discipline, Integrity, Resilience and Empathy. This is our Bendemeer experience. Where educating our students centres on the belief that each student is unique and their individual abilities differ widely.

We are also guided by the principles of Positive Education and will be continuing with the emphasis on building positive relationships, a culture of care and the growth mindset. We want our students to build positive relationships with their friends and teachers, take positive actions in their learning by being self-directed learners and use positive language to affirm one another.  

Exciting things await our students this year. When our students return to school they will experience our Get-It-Right (GIR) Programme. The programme aims to give our students an opportunity to get to know their peers, teachers and expectations in order to set the right tone before lessons begin. In addition, our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) on Environment Education and Sustainable Living has been cascaded to the P1 to P5 levels.  

We are also proud of our 2021 P6 cohort who has graduated and moved on to secondary school. They were the pioneer batch of students whose results were scored with the new Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) scoring system. We are pleased to note that the majority of students were posted to schools that were their first choice. We wish them well in their journey ahead! 

Our school’s operations team has also worked tirelessly during the holidays to ensure that the school is safe and ready for our students. Our teachers and staff have always placed safety as a top priority and I would like to thank them for all their hard work in getting the school and its spaces ready for the students. 

I am confident that with the continued support of our valued stakeholders, the unwavering dedication of the staff in Bendemeer and our commitment to provide the Bendemeer experience, our students will truly live up to being a gracious community of passionate learners and confident leaders. 

I look forward to another year of meaningful partnerships with all our stakeholders as we work hand in hand to provide the best learning experiences for our children.

  

Your partner-in-education,

Mrs Tan-Lim Kim Gek
