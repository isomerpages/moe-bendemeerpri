<p>At Bendemeer, we are deeply committed to nurturing an environment where
both staff and students can thrive — academically, socially and emotionally.
Central to this is a shared commitment to well-being, where learning and
well-being go hand in hand. We believe that when individuals feel safe,
supported and valued, they are better able to learn, grow and reach their
potential.</p>

<p>Our ethos of “Bendemeer Cares, Collaborates and Connects” continues to
guide us in all that we do. Care reminds us to look out for one another
with empathy and compassion. Collaboration strengthens our relationships
and collective responsibility. Connection anchors us to our families, partners
and the wider community, ensuring that no one walks this journey alone.</p>
<p>As our students return to school, they will once again take part in our
Get-It-Right (GIR) Programme, which sets the tone for the year by helping
students build strong relationships with their teachers and peers, establish
positive routines, and understand expectations. This programme reflects
our belief that every classroom should be a sanctuary — a safe space where
students feel confident to take risks, make mistakes, ask questions and
grow as learners and individuals.
<br>
</p>
<p>This year, we remain intentional in cultivating classrooms and school
spaces where trust, respect and psychological safety are prioritised. When
students feel safe to be themselves, they are more willing to engage deeply,
persevere through challenges and develop resilience. Our role as a school
is not only to impart knowledge, but to create environments where students
feel empowered to learn with confidence and courage.</p>
<p>Our curriculum continues to provide rich and meaningful learning experiences.
Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) on Environmental Education and Sustainable
Living remains a cornerstone of our learning, nurturing responsible and
environmentally conscious citizens. We also continue to support our students
through initiatives such as MOE’s UPLIFT programme, ensuring that those
who need additional support are cared for holistically.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For our P4 and P5 students, the IGNITE programme will once again offer
opportunities to explore interests and passions through hands-on workshops
and courses. These experiences encourage student voice, autonomy and confidence,
helping our students discover their strengths and develop a love for learning
beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>We deeply value the strong partnerships we have built with families, recognising
that education is most powerful when school and home work together hand
in hand. We are grateful for the trust, support and collaboration of our
parents, and we look forward to continuing to build meaningful connections
with you throughout the year. We also treasure our partnerships with local
and overseas schools, which broaden our students’ perspectives and enrich
their learning experiences.</p>
<p>As we reflect on the achievements of our students — whether in academics,
sports, the arts or leadership — we are reminded that success is not defined
solely by outcomes, but by character, resilience and growth along the way.
We are proud of our graduates who have moved on to the next chapter of
their journey, and we remain committed to nurturing every Bendemeer student
to become a passionate learner and a confident leader.</p>
<p>As we embark on another year together, we reaffirm our purpose: to craft
safe, caring and connected spaces where every child can learn well and
live well. With the dedication of our staff, the partnership of our families
and the collective strength of our community, I am confident that Bendemeer
will continue to grow from strength to strength.
<br>
</p>
<p>Here’s to a meaningful, joyful and fulfilling year ahead — for our students,
our staff and our entire Bendemeer family.
<br>
</p>
<p>Your partner-in-education,</p>
<p>Mrs Tan-Lim Kim Gek</p>
<p>Principal</p>
