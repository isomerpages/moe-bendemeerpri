### PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE

**Mrs Tan-Lim Kim Gek’s Welcome Back to School Message 2023**

<img src="/images/Mrs%20Tan%20.jpg" style="width:45%; padding: 20px" align="left"/>



A warm welcome to all our parents and students. I would like to extend my welcome to
our pioneer batch of students and staff from the MOE Kindergarten (MK) who have
joined our Bendemeer family this year.
Our focus this year is ‘Know me. Affirm me. Nurture me.’ We are also guided by the
principles of Positive Education and will be continuing with the emphasis on using
positive language, building positive relationships as well as demonstrating positive
actions in all we do.
Exciting things await our students this year. In 2022, we saw the nation moving towards
normalcy, making possible the return of school experiences like learning journeys, the
P5 camp as well as our annual Honours Day. I am pleased to share that almost all the
school programmes will be back in full swing in 2023.
Our school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) on Environment Education and
Sustainable Living has been cascaded to the P1 to P5 levels. In addition, the school will
be launching IGNITE- Interest Groups to Nurture and Inspire through Experiences. This
programme aims to offer students workshops or courses that our P5 students can
decide to take up based on their interest after school. The school is also onboard
MOE’s UPLIFT and KidsRead programmes which aim to support and strengthen
support for disadvantaged students.
One event that we will all be looking forward to is our 45th Anniversary celebrations. We
are indeed honoured to celebrate 45 years of inspiring to ASPIRE. We have come so
far thanks to the support of our alumni, parents and community partners who have been
so generous with their support. To mark this milestone event, the school will be
presenting ‘Rhapsody@ Bendemeer’ in Term 3.
We are also proud of our 2022 P6 cohort who has graduated and moved on to
secondary school. We are pleased to share that majority of our students were posted to
schools that were their first choice. We wish them well in their journey ahead!
I am confident that with the continued support of our valued stakeholders, the
unwavering dedication of the staff in Bendemeer and our commitment to provide the
Bendemeer experience, our students will truly live up to being a gracious community of
passionate learners and confident leaders.
I look forward to another year of meaningful partnerships with all our stakeholders as we
work hand in hand to provide the best learning experiences for our children.

Your partner-in-education,

Mrs Tan-Lim Kim Gek <br>
Principal
