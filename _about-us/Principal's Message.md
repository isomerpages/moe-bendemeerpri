<p>At Bendemeer, we are committed to building an enabling and caring school
environment where every student feels valued, heard, and supported. Our
goal is to create a space where students are happy, challenged, and nurtured
within a safe and encouraging setting. This year, our focus is encapsulated
in the theme: <em>“Know Me. Affirm Me. Nurture Me.”</em>

<p>Guided by the principles of Positive Education, we will continue to emphasise
the use of positive language, building strong relationships, and demonstrating
kindness and resilience in all that we do.
<br>
<br>As our students return to school, they will engage in our <em>Get-It-Right (GIR) Programme</em>,
designed to set the right tone before lessons begin. This programme helps
students build meaningful connections with their peers and teachers while
clarifying expectations to ensure a positive start to the school year.
Additionally, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) on Environmental Education
and Sustainable Living remains a cornerstone of our curriculum, fostering
awareness and responsibility towards sustainability.</p>
<p>This year, we are placing a special focus on enhancing classroom experiences
to make learning more dynamic, relevant, and joyful. By cultivating curiosity,
creativity, and collaboration, we aim to make every lesson an opportunity
for exploration and discovery. Our goal is for every student to feel inspired
and intrinsically motivated to learn, recognizing that education is not
just about outcomes but the journey itself.</p>
<p>We are also proud to support and uplift our students through programmes
like MOE’s <em>UPLIFT</em> initiative, which strengthens and enhances support
for disadvantaged students. Alongside these, our <em>IGNITE</em> programme
will offer our P4 and P5 students the chance to explore their passions
through workshops and courses tailored to their interests. By encouraging
independence, initiative, and engagement, we hope to nurture self-directed
learners who approach challenges with confidence and curiosity.</p>
<p>Beyond academics, we treasure the partnerships we have built with schools,
including Bendemeer Secondary, Raffles Institution, St Joseph’s Institution,
Catholic Junior College, and St Andrew’s Junior College. These collaborations
provide enriching opportunities for our students to grow. We also value
our international connections, which have allowed our students to learn
from peers worldwide, including those in Hong Kong, Malaysia, China, and
India. Such exchanges broaden their horizons and help them appreciate diverse
cultures and perspectives.</p>
<p>We celebrate our students’ achievements in various domains, including
their outstanding performances in the National School Games and the SYF
Arts Presentation. Through these successes, we hope our students not only
develop their talents but also build resilience, teamwork, and character.</p>
<p>Lastly, we commend our 2024 P6 cohort, who have moved on to secondary
schools, with many securing their first-choice placements. We are proud
of their achievements and confident they will continue to shine in their
next chapter.</p>
<p>As we embark on another year, we remain steadfast in our vision to nurture
a gracious community of passionate learners and confident leaders. By embracing
each child’s uniqueness and fostering their individual strengths, we continue
to grow from strength to strength.</p>
<p>I am confident that with the continued support of our valued stakeholders,
the unwavering dedication of the staff in Bendemeer and our commitment
to provide the Bendemeer experience, our students will truly live up to
being a gracious community of passionate learners and confident leaders.</p>
<p>Here’s to a wonderful year ahead!</p>
<p>Your partner-in-education,</p>
<p>Mrs Tan-Lim Kim Gek</p>
