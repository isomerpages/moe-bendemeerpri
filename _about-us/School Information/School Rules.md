Handphone Policy

  

17. We strongly encourage our students to use the school’s phone in the General Office to contact parents if they are not feeling well or in an emergency. Hence, there is no need for them to bring a handphone to school.

18. However, if the students bring a handphone to school, they are responsible to keep it safely with them. All phones are to be switched off and can only be switched on after school at 1.30pm in the canteen or school foyer.

19. The school shall not be responsible for the loss of the handphone due to whatever reasons-theft, carelessness, negligence, etc. As school curriculum time is sacred and disruption to teaching and learning is viewed very seriously, the school will not assist in conducting any search of the school premises or individual student to locate the missing handphone.

20. Student’s handphone will be confiscated by the school staff if he/she misuses the handphone during curriculum time, CCA, remedial or supplementary lessons. The Pupil Management team will contact the parent to collect the handphone.

21. During national examinations, students must hand over their handphones to the General Office for safe-keeping and will be able to retrieve it after the end of the examination. Students found with handphones in their possession during the examinations will be deemed as having the intention to cheat and will be dealt with in accordance to the examination rules.
