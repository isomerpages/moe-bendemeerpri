Altogether now we come as one

Bendemeer Primary

Through confidence and self-direction

Learning for a future we’ll lead

  

With strong moral values guiding us

A courageous vibrancy

Exploring the world

Staying true to Singapore our country

  

BPS! BPS!

Hand-in-Hand

In pursuit with passion

Be the best that one can be

  

Our crest and colours all inspire us

This vision we’ll achieve

The mission which unites us all

One Bendemeer One Family
