### SCHOOL SONG

<p align="center">
	Altogether now we come as one <br>
	Bendemeer Primary <br>
	Through confidence and self-direction <br>
	Learning for a future we’ll lead <br>
	<br>
	With strong moral values guiding us <br>
	A courageous vibrancy<br>
	Exploring the world<br>
	Staying true to Singapore our country <br>
	<br>  
	BPS! BPS! <br>
	Hand-in-Hand <br>
	In pursuit with passion <br>
	Be the best that one can be <br>
	<br>
	Our crest and colours all inspire us<br>
	This vision we’ll achieve <br>
	The mission which unites us all <br>
	One Bendemeer One Family <br>
