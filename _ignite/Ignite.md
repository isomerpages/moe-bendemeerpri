IGNITE Programme Interest Groups for Nurturing and  
Transforming Through Experiences  
IGNITE aims to offer our P5 students workshops or courses that  
our P5 students can decide to take up based on their interest.  
The rationale for this programme is to give our students  
autonomy in their learning. When students are given  
opportunities to be independent, to be engaged and to pursue  
their own interests, they will be more motivated. When  
students have the ability to do that, they persist longer in the  
face of difficulties. They show more initiative and curiosity as  
well as develop a greater sense of confidence in their ability. 

In Semester 1, P5 supplementary is not conducted. Instead, the  
time is given to the IGNITE programme. Teachers from  
Bendemeer were given the freedom to come up with their own  
interest groups to be conducted during the time. Some  
examples of the interest groups conducted are: Coding, Baking,  
Table Tennis, Soccer Debate, Appreciating Chinese Culture,  
Playing the Kompang and more.  

Students were given the autonomy to choose which workshops  
they would like to sign up for and can choose up to two  
workshops. The programme will culminate in the students  
sharing what they have learnt from the programme. Through  
this programme, we hope that our students find their X-factor  
and are motivated to learn in school.
