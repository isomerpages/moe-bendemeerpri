<h3>Festive Community Outreach</h3>
<p>At Bendemeer Primary School, we strongly believe that partnership should
be nurtured within the school and then be shared within our neighbouring
community. Presenting our signature partnership event â€“ our Festive Community
Outreach whereby during Chinese New Year, Hari Raya and Deepavali, our
school leaders, students and staff visit the businesses around the neighbourhood
to spread the festive joy!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our students also prepare creative and meaningful handcrafted gifts to
present to the business owners as a keepsake.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 situation ignited a very important partnership opportunity
for us. Since the Partnership &amp; PSG Committee could not perform our
Festive Community Outreach within our immediate neighbourhood community,
we connected with our non-teaching staff!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This way, we continue to forge and deepen our positive relationship with
these important groups of stakeholders with the warm presence of the Bendemeer
family!</p>
