### Festive Community Outreach 

At Bendemeer Primary School, we strongly believe that partnership should be nurtured within the school and then be shared within our neighbouring community. Presenting our signature partnership event – our Festive Community Outreach whereby during Chinese New Year, Hari Raya and Deepavali, our school leaders, students and staff visit the businesses around the neighbourhood to spread the festive joy! 

Our students also prepare creative and meaningful handcrafted gifts to present to the business owners as a keepsake.

The Covid-19 situation ignited a very important partnership opportunity for us. Since the Partnership & PSG Committee could not perform our Festive Community Outreach within our immediate neighbourhood community, we connected with our non-teaching staff! 

This way, we continue to forge and deepen our positive relationship with these important groups of stakeholders with the warm presence of the Bendemeer family!

To usher in the Year of the Rabbit 2023, our School Leaders and P4 Student Leaders connected with the neighbouring businesses during our annual Chinese New Year Festive Outreach on 17 January 2023. Once again, the shop owners were all very excited and we all exchanged CNY greetings and well wishes. The Student Leaders also gave them cute bunny-themed craftwork as they hopped from shop to shop.

Back in school, our School Leaders extended their greetings to all non-teaching staff. This year, we are also delighted to have our Kindergarten Care (KCare) and MOE Kindergarten (MK) staff to join us in the festivities for the first time! Our Bendemeer family has indeed grown bigger!

On 29 April 2022, our school leaders and student leaders distributed Hari Raya decorations to the non-teaching staff as part of connecting and strengthening the partnership bond with them. These 3-D decorations were lovingly made by the P3 and P4 students and each piece was very detailed, colourful and reflected the patience and passion in creating these! Our non-teaching staff were very excited to receive this work of art and gave their thanks.

Our P4 student leaders were very enthusiastic when they got to go out of school last Thursday, 3 November 2022. Why was that so? They were finally able to participate in the Deepavali Festive Outreach with the School Leaders to present craftwork to the neighbouring shops and businesses for the first time in more than two years! Several shopkeepers shared with us that they vividly remembered that our students presented the craftwork to them some years ago. It was a heartening sight to see our student leaders and shopkeepers exchanging greetings and thanks! Upon returning to school, the student leaders also presented the craftwork to the non-teaching staff.
