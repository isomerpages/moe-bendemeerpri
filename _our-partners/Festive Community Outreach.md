### Festive Community Outreach 

At Bendemeer Primary School, we strongly believe that partnership should be nurtured within the school and then be shared within our neighbouring community. Presenting our signature partnership event â€“ our Festive Community Outreach whereby during Chinese New Year, Hari Raya and Deepavali, our school leaders, students and staff visit the businesses around the neighbourhood to spread the festive joy!&nbsp;

Our students also prepare creative and meaningful handcrafted gifts to present to the business owners as a keepsake.

The Covid-19 situation ignited a very important partnership opportunity for us. Since the Partnership &amp; PSG Committee could not perform our Festive Community Outreach within our immediate neighbourhood community, we connected with our non-teaching staff!&nbsp;

This way, we continue to forge and deepen our positive relationship with these important groups of stakeholders with the warm presence of the Bendemeer family!
