<p>During the Teachers’ Day celebrations on 29 August 2024, our alumni returned

former students gathered in the school hall that morning, with many arriving
right after their secondary school celebrations—some even traveling from
distant locations. This heartfelt reunion is a testament to the lasting
impact our BPS teachers have had on their lives.</p>

<p>Our courageous NE Champs participated in the 2024 Civil Defence Junior
Lionhearters Challenge on 23 February 2024, an event organised by the Singapore
Civil Defence Force. Leading up to the challenge, the team dedicated significant
time and effort to mastering First Aid skills, locating AEDs around the
school, earning their Community Emergency Preparedness Tier 1 Certificates,
and designing their own version of the SCDF Ready Bag, complete with a
custom-painted design.</p>
<p>During the challenge, the team demonstrated exceptional teamwork and resilience
as they competed against other primary schools, solving puzzles and answering
quizzes related to emergency preparedness. We are proud to share that their
Ready Bag design ranked among the top 10 schools! The team was thrilled
that their hard work paid off and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.</p>
