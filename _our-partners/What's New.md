<p>Bendemeer Primary School warmly welcomed our alumni back for Homecoming
during Teachers’ Day 2025. It was a meaningful occasion filled with joyful
reunions, heartfelt conversations, and expressions of gratitude for the
teachers who shaped their journeys. Our alumni shared fond memories, reconnected
with former teachers and friends, and celebrated the strong Bendemeer spirit
that continues to unite generations. We are grateful for their presence
and for the enduring bonds that make our Bendemeer family truly special.</p>

<p>Bendemeer Primary School thanks Kolam Ayer Community Club for their thoughtful
support for our Primary 6 students. The People’s Association Youth Movement
(PAYM) and the Kolam Ayer Youth Network prepared care packs for our students,
and Dr Wan Rizal included a personal message in each pack to motivate them
as they prepare for the PSLE.</p>
<p>We appreciate this meaningful partnership and value their continued commitment
to nurturing the well-being and confidence of our Bendemeer students.</p>

<p>Our Primary 4 and Primary 5 NE Champs represented Bendemeer Primary School
at the 2025 Civil Defence Junior Lionhearters Challenge, organised by the
Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). The competition brought together
students from schools across Singapore to test their emergency preparedness
knowledge, teamwork, and quick thinking. We are proud to share that our
students once again clinched a spot in the Top 10 Ready Bag Design category
for the third consecutive year! This achievement reflects their creativity,
resilience, and commitment to staying prepared. We congratulate our NE
Champs for flying the Bendemeer flag high and thank SCDF for providing
this meaningful learning opportunity.</p>
