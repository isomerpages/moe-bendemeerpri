<p><em>“To bring out the best in every child”.</em>
</p>
<p>After many years of a pandemic standstill, Bendemeer Primary School(BPS)
learns beyond the borders of Singapore into a world of opportunities filled
with diverse cultures and building each student up to be a passionate learner
and confident leader.</p>
<p>This year, Hong Kong school, Yan Chai Hospital Chio Hin To Primary School(YCHCHTPS),
hosted our students warmly into their school.&nbsp; YCHCHTPS kicked off
the trip with a tour of its student-led Ecology lab whereby students cared
for the pets’ basic needs and learning about biodiversity. Additionally,
BPS’ students were dazzled by her host’s state-of-the-art simulation room
where personal drawings were uploaded
<br>for real-time interactions.</p>

<p>BPS’ students were treated to a rich experience of local performances
by her host. With dynamic martial arts performances and beautiful traditional
Chinese Orchestra music, BPS were entertained by such talents. To return
the favour, BPS performed a rendition of an acapella rhythmic performance
“<em>Singapura, Oh Singapura” </em>and <em>“A Million Dreams”</em> from the
musical <em>The Greatest Showman.</em>  <em>&nbsp;</em>

<p>This exchange also allowed for friendships to be forged through activities
and workshops together. Students were given many opportunities to not only
learn various concepts but to work together to achieve a common goal. From
cracking secret cipher codes written in roman numeracies to building a
robot, the inter-relations between BPS &amp; YCHCHTPS were iron-forged
reinforced. To practice her gratitude, BPS students wrote gratitude cards,
a common practice done back at home, to appreciate their new teachers and
friends for their guidance, patience and hospitality.</p>
<p>Beyond learning within classroom walls, BPS visited places of interest
such as the Hong Kong Science Museum. From playing chess with an AI to
doing simple hand gestures for computer-related tasks, students learnt
about machine learning, deep neural networks and IoTs.</p>

<p>In addition, students learnt about sustainability efforts around the world
and how HK makes its mark by visiting HK’s <em>“Zero Carbon”</em> building.
The building, renowned for its innovative design and natural landscapes,
depicts how architecture and environmental consciousness can harmonise
and reduce carbon footprints.</p>
<p>All work and no play makes BPS a dull school. The students enjoyed the
bustling city life of Hong Kong through her visit to the renowned Victoria
Peak; a breath-taking tour to HK UNESCO Global Geopark and even night shopping
at Temple Street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, the journey for BPS students was an enriching fusion of educational
experiences, cultural exchanges and environmental awareness. The trip has
left a deep impression on each student. May these experiences propel them
to be more confident and passionate learners.&nbsp;</p>
