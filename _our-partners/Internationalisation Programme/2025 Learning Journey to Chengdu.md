<p>On 10 November, our Primary 5 students and teachers set forth on a 5-day
Overseas Learning Journey to Chengdu, China. Through immersive school exchanges,
hands-on STEM activities and rich cultural experiences, the programme aimed
to deepen cultural understanding, nurture global awareness and develop
21st Century Competencies while providing meaningful opportunities for
students to live out the school’s ASPIRE values in authentic contexts.</p>
<p>The journey began with the students’ arrival in Chengdu, a city known
for its rich heritage and rapid innovation. Excitement and curiosity filled
the air as students prepared to experience life and learning beyond the
classroom, setting the tone for a purposeful and reflective learning journey.</p>

<p>A key highlight was the school immersion at <strong>The Primary School Affiliated to Shishi Tianfu High School</strong>.
Students and staff participated alongside their Chinese counterparts in
the retelling of a Chinese folktale and learning music with AI. Our students
also had the opportunity to get their hands busy with some Chinese handicrafts
guided by their friends in Shishi Tianfu.</p>

<p>This cultural exchange allowed students to observe a different education
system, witness how technology can enhance creativity to bring about engaged
learning and build friendships through shared classroom experiences. The
visit fostered mutual respect and appreciation for diverse approaches to
teaching and learning.</p>

<p>Beyond the school campus, students explored <strong>Kuanzhai Alley</strong> and <strong>Taikoo Li Chengdu</strong>,
where traditional architecture blended seamlessly with modern urban design.
These visits encouraged students to reflect on how cities preserve cultural
heritage while embracing development. After visiting the Giant Panda at
IFS Mall, staff and students saw some amazing 3D art come to life at the
junction of Taikoo Li streets!</p>

<p>On Day 3, hands-on experiential learning continued at <strong>So Young Land</strong>,
where students engaged in collaborative problem-solving tasks. Inspired
by Lu Ban, the renowned Chinese carpenter and architect, our students worked
in pairs to construct arch bridges using only wooden sticks, applying principles
of engineering, design thinking and teamwork. In another activity, students
worked in groups to design and build homes on Mars using Lego, imagining
solutions for sustainable living should Mother Earth face environmental
challenges one day. These activities nurtured creativity, critical thinking
and resilience while highlighting the importance of sustainability and
innovation.</p>

<p>Cultural and scientific exploration were featured strongly in the journey.
At the <strong>Sichuan Science and Technology Museum</strong>, students
interacted with tons of hands-on exhibits that brought science concepts
to life, reinforcing curiosity and inquiry. Our absolute favourite was
the Tilting House, an optical illusion that had all our senses spinning
as we tried to make our way through!</p>

<p>A visit to <strong>Tianfu Art Park</strong> provided exposure to artistic
expressions and public spaces that reflect the city’s cultural identity
and emphasis on community living. We were blown away by its stunning modern
architecture. The peaceful surroundings were a perfect escape from the
city buzz!</p>

and educational exchanges.</p>

<p>One of the most memorable experiences was the visit to the <strong>Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding to see the stars of Chengdu – the Giant Pandas!</strong> Students
learned about conservation efforts to protect this national treasure. This
experience deepened their understanding of biodiversity, environmental
responsibility and the importance of sustainable practices.</p>

<p>After lunch, we were blessed to see vibrant chrysanthemums in full bloom
as we strolled through <strong>Chengdu People’s Park</strong>. It was truly
a sight to behold!</p>

<p>The cultural immersion was further enriched through hands-on activities
such as <strong>opera mask painting</strong>, where students learned about
the symbolism behind Sichuan Opera masks. The day culminated in a live <strong>Sichuan face-changing performance</strong> during
dinner, leaving students in awe of this unique art form and deepening their
appreciation of Chinese performing arts.</p>

<p>In this fun-filled OLJ, our students stepped out of their comfort zones
to demonstrate adaptability as they adjusted to new environments and routines.
They learned to exercise self-discipline and independence in managing daily
responsibilities, approached challenges with resilience and worked collaboratively
with peers with a growing sense of empathy and respect. Their active participation
in learning activities also reflected a genuine passion for discovery.
Their interactions with peers, teachers and members of the community consistently
upheld integrity, reflecting an increasing awareness of their role as representatives
of BPS and Singapore！</p>
