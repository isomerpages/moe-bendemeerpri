<p>For five days, our Primary 5 students and teachers embarked on an Overseas
Learning Journey to Hong Kong, where classroom learning was brought to
life through culture, science and sustainability. The programme aimed to
deepen cross-cultural understanding, strengthen 21st Century Competencies
and nurture the ASPIRE values in authentic settings.</p>
<p>The journey began at <strong>Madame Tussauds</strong>, where students were
surprised by the lifelike wax figures of world leaders, athletes and celebrities.
What they expected to be a simple museum turned into an engaging experience
that sparked lively conversations about fame, influence and history. This
was followed by a visit to <strong>Victoria Peak</strong>, where students
took in the sweeping skyline of Hong Kong. The spectacular view prompted
reflections on urban planning, sustainability and the shared challenges
of modern cities like Singapore and Hong Kong.</p>

<p>One of the most memorable moments was the <strong>school exchange with Yan Chai Hospital Choi Hin To Primary School</strong>.
Students participated in classroom lessons, cultural presentations and
interactive games alongside their Hong Kong peers. These exchanges gave
our students the chance to share about Singapore’s traditions and school
life while learning about the customs and routines of another education
system. The friendships formed during this exchange laid the foundation
for lasting connections and highlighted the value of collaboration across
borders.</p>

<p>At the <strong>Hong Kong Science Museum</strong>, students engaged with
hands-on exhibits that turned abstract concepts into real-world learning.
The interactive galleries nurtured curiosity and inquiry, reinforcing the
importance of scientific literacy and innovation. Students reflected on
how science and technology shape everyday life and how they could play
a role in driving future discoveries.</p>

<p>The programme also took students outdoors to the <strong>Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark</strong>,
where dramatic rock formations and guided learning sessions underscored
the importance of preserving natural heritage. At the <strong>Zero Carbon Building</strong>,
students learned about renewable energy and sustainable living practices,
sparking discussions on how Singapore could adopt similar eco-friendly
strategies. Both experiences strengthened their awareness of climate action
and environmental responsibility.</p>

<p>Cultural immersion was another highlight. At the bustling <strong>Temple Street Night Market</strong>,
students explored the sights, sounds and flavours of Hong Kong’s street
life, while the <strong>Avenue of Stars</strong> showcased the region’s rich
cinematic heritage. These visits encouraged students to see culture not
only as history and tradition, but also as a living expression of identity.</p>

<p>Throughout the journey, students demonstrated adaptability in new environments,
self-discipline in managing their responsibilities and perseverance during
physically demanding activities. They consistently displayed integrity,
respect and empathy in their interactions with peers, hosts and members
of the public. Teachers and students also bonded through shared experiences,
supporting one another and building a strong sense of camaraderie.</p>
<p>The Overseas Learning Journey to Hong Kong expanded perspectives, strengthened
friendships and provided valuable lessons beyond the classroom. Above all,
the journey allowed our students to practise the <strong>ASPIRE school values</strong> in
meaningful ways, building confidence, resilience and empathy that will
guide them in the years ahead.</p>
