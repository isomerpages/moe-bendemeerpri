<h2>Internationalisation Programme at BPS</h2>
<p>Each year, selected students embark on Overseas Learning Journeys to our
partner schools in the region, a key feature of our Internationalisation
Programme. These experiences open doors for our students to broaden their
horizons, build cross-cultural friendships, and deepen their appreciation
of learning beyond the classroom. By connecting with peers overseas, our
students grow as confident learners and responsible citizens, while strengthening
Bendemeer’s vision of nurturing friendship beyond borders.</p>
