<p>Penang became a living classroom for our Primary 5 students and teachers
as they embarked on a three-day Overseas Learning Journey to Malaysia.
The experience provided valuable opportunities for cultural exchange, experiential
learning and the strengthening of bonds among peers and teachers.</p>
<p>The programme began with a visit to <strong>Entopia by Penang Butterfly Farm</strong>,
where students explored biodiversity and gained a deeper appreciation of
nature’s ecosystems. They also had hands-on exposure to Malaysia’s vibrant
performing arts.</p>

<p>A heritage walk along <strong>Armenian Street</strong> introduced students
to the cultural tapestry of George Town and allowed them to explore local
traditions and shops. At <strong>Fort Cornwallis</strong>, they gained insights
into Penang’s colonial past, linking history to the region’s development.</p>

<p>A key highlight was the school exchange with <strong>Penang Chinese Girls’ Primary School</strong>.
Our students took part in classroom activities, presentations and cultural
exchanges with their Malaysian peers. This authentic interaction not only
fostered new friendships but also offered insights into the long history
of a school established by the Hokkien community in 1919, which continues
to play a significant role in Penang’s education landscape.</p>

<p>Students and teachers also bonded over shared meals, enjoying Penang’s
renowned cuisine from hawker favourites to traditional dishes. These dining
moments became a memorable part of the journey, filled with conversation,
laughter and cultural discovery.</p>
<p>The itinerary also included the <strong>Tuanku Fauziah Museum &amp; Gallery</strong>,
where students were introduced to the traditional art of <em>Wayang Kulit</em>,
and a trip to <strong>Penang Hill</strong>, where they marvelled at the
island’s scenic beauty. At the <strong>Tech Dome</strong>, located in KOMTAR,
students explored over 120 interactive exhibits across fields such as robotics,
optics and astronomy, sparking curiosity and reinforcing the importance
of scientific inquiry.</p>

<p>Throughout the journey, students engaged in individual and group reflections.
They shared how the trip had built their confidence to step out of their
comfort zones, encouraged meaningful interaction with peers from another
country, and highlighted both similarities and differences between life
in Singapore and Penang. Many reflected on the importance of respecting
cultural traditions and working together as a team. These thoughtful sharing
revealed not only what they had learned but also how they had grown to
becoming more independent, empathetic and collaborative.</p>
<p>The Overseas Learning Journey to Penang reminded everyone that learning
extends beyond the classroom and plays an important role in developing
future-ready, globally-minded citizens. Most importantly, the trip gave
our students the opportunity to live out the <strong>ASPIRE values</strong> which
mean demonstrating adaptability, self-discipline, perseverance, integrity,
respect and empathy throughout their journey.</p>
