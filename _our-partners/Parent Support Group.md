<p>Our school’s Parent Support Group (PSG) is a dedicated community of parents
who actively enrich the learning experiences of our students. More than
volunteers, our PSG members are trusted partners in building a vibrant
and supportive school environment.</p>
<p>Since its humble formation, the PSG has become an innovative and energetic
extension of our school’s Partnership &amp; PSG Committee. Parent volunteers
contribute their skills and talents to school events, programmes and community
initiatives, strengthening home–school bonds and creating meaningful experiences
for our students.</p>
<p>We believe parents are powerful partners in education. Your involvement
not only enhances school programmes but also inspires pride and motivation
in your child. Whether through arts, sports, professional expertise or
event support, every contribution makes a difference.</p>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create opportunities for parents to participate in school life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthen home–school partnerships to support student growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspire students as they witness their parents’ active involvement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why Join the PSG?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stay connected and informed about school programmes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a positive impact on your child’s learning journey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contribute to a caring and engaging school environment.</p>
</li>

<p>Joining the PSG is more than volunteering. It is about making a difference,
building memories with your child, and being part of a vibrant school community
where every student can thrive.</p>
