<p>Our school’s Parent Support Group (PSG) was formed by a group of parents
who have a keen interest in contributing towards the school community and
who readily impart their skills and render their services to the school.&nbsp;
Over the years, the PSG has forged a strong and trusted relationship with
the school.</p>
<p>The PSG is now a motivated and innovative voluntary wing of our school’s
Partnership &amp; PSG Committee.&nbsp; The school and neighbouring community
have benefited much from activities the PSG supported over the years.&nbsp;
We are looking forward to recruiting more parent volunteers to help the
PSG grow and blossom. We aspire to invite parents to share their skills
and area of expertise with the students and staff.</p>
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To provide opportunities for parents to be involved in the school activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To foster greater bonding between school and families.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To give children a sense of pride as they witness the involvement of their
parents in school.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Benefits of being a PSG member</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Able to keep abreast of the school’s programmes.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
