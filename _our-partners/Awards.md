<h4><strong>Celebrating Our National Honour: Total Defence Awards 2025 &amp; NS Mark (Gold)!</strong></h4>
<p>Bendemeer Primary School is honoured to be recognised once again at the
national level with the Total Defence Awards (TDA) 2025 and the NS Mark
(Gold), Singapore’s highest accolades for exemplary contributions to Total
Defence. Jointly conferred by the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the
Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), these awards affirm our school’s unwavering
commitment to promoting resilience, responsibility, and unity within our
student body and wider community.</p>

<p>This achievement builds on our earlier recognition in 2022, when Bendemeer
Primary received the National Service (NS) Advocate Award for Organisations
and the NS Mark (Gold) under the TDA framework. As these honours are awarded
on a three-year cycle, attaining them again in 2025 highlights our sustained
efforts and consistent support for Total Defence and National Service.</p>
<p>Beyond being a prestigious accolade, this milestone celebrates the collective
dedication of our staff, students, parents, and community partners including
the SAF, SPF, and SCDF. It reinforces our mission to nurture responsible
citizens who stand steadfast for Singapore and strengthens our resolve
to cultivate a school culture grounded in service, resilience, and unity.</p>

from SINDA at the SINDA Appreciation Ceremony 2025. This recognition celebrates
our long-standing collaboration, and the meaningful support SINDA has provided
to our students and families over the years. This year is especially significant,
as it marks the 23rd year of our partnership which is a true testament
to the shared commitment between Bendemeer Primary and SINDA in nurturing
the growth, confidence, and well-being of every child. We look forward
to continuing this strong and purposeful partnership in the years ahead.</p>

<p>The National Service (NS) Advocate Award for Organisations which is part

by MINDEF that recognises a wide array of stakeholders’ exemplary support
for NS, including individuals, small and medium enterprises, large companies
and organisations.</p>

<p>Bendemeer Primary School was a recipient of this prestigious award on
10 November 2022. This award affirms the continued good work that the school
has put in place to support and recognise its NSmen and the efforts to
inculcate Total Defence as a whole-school approach.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MINDEF acknowledges the efforts our school took to achieve the above in
a detailed report submitted for the application of this award. This award
is also one step higher than the NS Mark (Gold) accreditation that our
school achieved in 2021 and we were first conferred the TDA ‘Meritorious
Defence Partner Award’ back in 2012 and 2013.</p>
