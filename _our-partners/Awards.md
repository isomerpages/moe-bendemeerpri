<p>The National Service (NS) Advocate Award for Organisations which is part
of the Total Defence Awards (TDA) 2022, is the highest national accolade
by MINDEF that recognises a wide array of stakeholders’ exemplary support
for NS, including individuals, small and medium enterprises, large companies
and organisations.</p>

<p>Bendemeer Primary School was a recipient of this prestigious award on
10 November 2022. This award affirms the continued good work that the school
has put in place to support and recognise its NSmen and the efforts to
inculcate Total Defence as a whole-school approach.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MINDEF acknowledges the efforts our school took to achieve the above in
a detailed report submitted for the application of this award. This award
is also one step higher than the NS Mark (Gold) accreditation that our
school achieved in 2021 and we were first conferred the TDA ‘Meritorious
Defence Partner Award’ back in 2012 and 2013.</p>
