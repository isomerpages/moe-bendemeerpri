section.</p>

<h4>Penang Heritage Walk and Entopia</h4>
<p>A visit to Penang is not complete without a visit to the Unesco World
Heritage site. Here, our students soaked in the sights and sounds of the
bustling Armenian Street while admiring some of the world-famous wall murals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The students also visited the interesting world of insects, reptiles and
amphibians. Before going on hunt at Entopia, the students learnt about
these animals and got to touch some of them as well. &nbsp;</p>

<h4>Penang Hill and Wayang Kulit Making at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM)</h4>
<p>Our students also had a chance to visit the highest peak in Penang, Bukit
Bendera or commonly known as Penang Hill. Going up the hill was an experience
in itself, on a funicular train that zoomed uphill.</p>

<p>&nbsp;They also had a hands-on wayang kulit making activity at the Tengku
Fauziah Museum and Art Gallery at USM. They had fun learning and crafting
their own wayang kulit characters. They also get to bring these home as
a keepsake of their visit here.</p>
