### Internationalisation Programme

Beyond our shores, our school has also cultivated and solidified its partnership efforts with student immersions with partner schools. All schools benefitted through exchanges of culture, food, dances, art and craft work during the immersions. As such, students and staff from all sides experience a myriad of learning experiences in sync with the theme of “Friendship beyond Boundaries”!

Have you heard of Warlie Art before? With much curiosity, our P5 students had an experience of creating their own Warlie Art pieces, an ancient Indian folk art, under the guidance of students of Bala Vinayaka Vidyaniketan (BVV) School located in India on 6 March 2023.&nbsp;

This gathering marked the first time Bendemeer Primary School partnered a school from India on a virtual immersion and students of both schools were treated to a colourful ensemble of cultural dances, cuisine, arts and craft albeit online. In exchange, BPS had the honour of meeting and hearing from Director, BVV School, Mr Vinayak R. as he shared his excitement of introducing BVV school to fellow Bendemeerians.&nbsp;

This immersion also affirms the warm and growing partnership between BVV school and Bendemeer Primary School and we look forward to meeting our Indian counterparts in Singapore soon!

BPS organised and held another virtual immersion with Chengdu Shi Shi High School (石室中学) on Wednesday, 26 October 2022. Both schools prepared materials on the theme of ‘New Year celebrations around the world’. Shi Shi High School shared with us a Chinese poem about the Chinese New Year called ‘Yuan Ri’&nbsp;(元日) and invited our Primary Six students to paint persimmons using authentic Chinese calligraphy materials. Our students followed the Chengdu teachers and students with much enthusiasm and concentration. In return, our school shared about the objectives of the Maker’s Innovation Lab and on how to make a Chinese lantern out of Ang Pow packets to bring in the idea of sustainability with Mrs Sheila Kin leading the craft-making session.

  

The immersion successfully concluded with school leaders, teachers and students of both school sharing their thoughts about the session and wishing each other well wishes. This immersion also enabled both schools to strike a common chord to strengthen our partnership and to involve our students in appreciating each other’s culture.

When was the last time you played with a ‘Rubik’s cube’? Our partner school from Chengdu, ‘Chengdu ShiShi High School’ ([石室中学](https://web.archive.org/web/20150626070856/http:/www.cdshishi.net/its/trans.aspx?id=2608))&nbsp;organised a Rubik’s cube tournament for their students on 31 May 2022 and Bendemeer Primary was invited to participate virtually alongside the Chengdu students. Amidst our P6 students, there were some who possessed this hidden talent and were very proficient with Rubik’s Cube! They played a friendly match with 6 Integrity cheering on as spectators. It was very heart-warming to see both schools sharing applause and words of encouragement! The Chengdu school commended that one of our students completed the Rubik’s cube puzzle in 30 seconds which was considered lightning fast! This tournament was held in conjunction with other activities as part of Children’s Day in China on 1 June 2022.

An innovative way of forging partnership and connecting with our overseas friends via ZOOM.

We had our inaugural virtual immersion with&nbsp;Sichuan Da Yi Bei Jie Primary School (大邑县北街小学) on 22 April 2022. The theme of ‘Friendship Beyond Boundaries’ was apparent and achieved as the students and teachers from both schools warmly welcomed one another, watched cultural performances and proceeded to work together to create lovely flower craftwork which symbolises unity, friendship and happiness. This immersion programme has not only allowed our students to connect with their foreign counterparts, but it also affirms the friendship and partnership between both schools.
