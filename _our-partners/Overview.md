<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>At Bendemeer Primary School, partnership is not an extra, it is the fabric
that binds our school family together. Guided by our vision of <em>A Gracious Community of Passionate Learners and Confident Leaders</em>,
we believe that every partnership enriches learning, nurtures character
and deepens our roots in the community.</p>

<p><strong><u>Our Journey and Approach</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our partnership journey began with bridge-building collaborations with
organisations such as Singapore General Hospital, MINDEF, and Project Chulia
Street. These early initiatives laid the foundation for our <em>Source – Strengthen – Sustain</em> model,
which guides how we grow meaningful and enduring partnerships. Every collaboration
is purposeful, mutually beneficial, and aligned to our school programmes
and the holistic development of our students.</p>

<p><strong><u>Our Parent Support Group (PSG)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our Parent Support Group is a cornerstone of home-school partnership.
The PSG and its EXCO lead by example by co-planning activities, supporting
key school events, and modelling positive values for our children. Parents
contribute through career talks, festive outreach, parent–child bonding
activities, and learning journeys. Together, they are visible ambassadors
of our school and champions of student well-being.</p>

<p><strong><u>Our Community Partners</u></strong>
</p>
<p>From community organisations such as Kolam Ayer Community Club, SBS Transit,
and Lions Befrienders, to international schools in Hong Kong, Chengdu,
Penang and India, our partners open doors for authentic experiences and
cultural exchange. Through Values-in-Action, festive community outreaches,
student-led projects, and international immersions, our students connect
their learning to real life, gaining confidence, resilience and civic consciousness.

<p><strong><u>Recognition and Impact</u></strong>
<br>
<br>We affirm our partners through our Partners Award and PSG Recognition
frameworks. These celebrate contributions that have supported student growth
across academic, social-emotional, aesthetic, physical, and citizenship
domains. Beyond awards, the true impact is seen in our students; confident
in leadership, connected with their peers, and proud to serve their community.</p>
