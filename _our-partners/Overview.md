<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>At Bendemeer Primary School, partnership is not an extra, it is the fabric
that binds our school family together. Guided by our vision of <em>A Gracious Community of Passionate Learners and Confident Leaders</em>,
we believe that every partnership enriches learning, nurtures character
and deepens our roots in the community.</p>

<p><strong><u>Our Journey and Approach</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our partnership journey began with bridge-building collaborations with
organisations such as Singapore General Hospital, MINDEF, and Project Chulia
Street. These early initiatives laid the foundation for our <em>Source – Strengthen – Sustain</em> model,
which guides how we grow meaningful and enduring partnerships. Every collaboration
is purposeful, mutually beneficial, and aligned to our school programmes
and the holistic development of our students.</p>

<p><strong><u>Our Parent Support Group (PSG)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our Parent Support Group is a cornerstone of home-school partnership.
The PSG and its EXCO lead by example by co-planning activities, supporting
key school events, and modelling positive values for our children. Parents
contribute through career talks, festive outreach, parent–child bonding
activities, and learning journeys. Together, they are visible ambassadors
of our school and champions of student well-being.</p>

<p><strong><u>Our Community Partners</u></strong>
</p>
<p>From community organisations such as Kolam Ayer Community Club, SBS Transit,
and Lions Befrienders, to international schools in Hong Kong, Chengdu,
Penang and India, our partners open doors for authentic experiences and
cultural exchange. Through Values-in-Action, festive community outreaches,
student-led projects, and international immersions, our students connect
their learning to real life, gaining confidence, resilience and civic consciousness.

<p><strong><u>Recognition and Impact</u></strong>
<br>
<br>We affirm our partners through our Partners Award and PSG Recognition
frameworks. These celebrate contributions that have supported student growth
across academic, social-emotional, aesthetic, physical, and citizenship
domains. Beyond awards, the true impact is seen in our students; confident
in leadership, connected with their peers, and proud to serve their community.</p>

<p><strong><u>Partnership From Within</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Our Signature Community Festive Outreach event</strong>
</p>
<p>The Covid-19 situation ignited a very important partnership opportunity
for us. Since the Partnership &amp; PSG Committee could not perform our
annual Festive Outreach within our immediate neighbourhood community, we
connected with our non-teaching staff! Our school leaders and students
presented the following festive gifts to our non-teaching staff:</p>

<p><strong><u>Partnership with the Community</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Saluting our SBS Transit Bus Captains!</strong>
</p>
<p>SBS Transit invited our school to participate in SBS Transit Kindness
Month in November 2021. Our students shared about which buses they took
to school and they also expressed their gratitude to the diligent and committed
bus captains in a video clip which was featured on SBS Transit’s Facebook.
The video clip was also screened to the&nbsp;Minister for Transport of
Singapore, Mr Chee Hong Tat, and guests&nbsp;during the Public Transport
Workers' Appreciation Event 2021. Access the following URL to watch the

<p><strong>Kindergarten E-Visit @ BPS 2022</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of our community outreach effort to prepare Kindergarten students
for primary school, our school hosted 24 kindergartens on an E-Visit on
13 April 2022. This experience provided both the K2 students and their
parents with a timely opportunity to learn about the interesting programmes,
infrastructure and latest facilities Bendemeer Primary School has to offer.
Ben, our school mascot, was featured together with our student leaders
in a video about life in BPS. There were also many light-hearted moments
when our Head Prefect, Jeannette Tham Shi Tong of 6 Adaptability, and Vice-Head
Prefect, Goh Ying Hui Zoey also of 6 Adaptability, answered questions from
the curious younger kinder!</p>

<p><strong>SCDF Junior Lionhearter Challenge 2022</strong>
</p>
<p>A group of P4 and P5 National Education (NE) Champs took park in the SCDF
Junior Lionhearter Challenge 2022 organised by the Singapore Civil Defence
Force. They participated in a series of exciting activities which included
them rallying their family members to download the SCDF’s myResponder app
and to register as Community First Responders.</p>
<p>These NE Champs were also trained to serve as Emergency Preparedness (EP)
ambassadors in own schools, spreading awareness amongst their fellow schoolmates,
family members and friends on the importance of knowing life-saving skills
and helping one another in an emergency.</p>

<p><strong>Virtual Partnership – Friendship Beyond Boundaries</strong>
</p>
<p>We had our inaugural virtual immersion with&nbsp;Sichuan Da Yi Bei Jie
Primary School (大邑县北街小学) on 22 April 2022. The theme of ‘Friendship Beyond
Boundaries’ was apparent and achieved as the students and teachers from
both schools warmly welcomed one another, watched cultural performances
and proceeded to work together to create lovely flower craftwork which
symbolises unity, friendship and happiness. This immersion programme has
not only allowed our students to connect with their foreign counterparts,
but it also affirms the friendship and partnership between both schools.</p>

<p><strong>Rubik’s Cube friendly tournament organised by BPS’s partner school</strong>
</p>
<p>When was the last time you played with a ‘Rubik’s cube’? Our partner school
from Chengdu, ‘Chengdu ShiShi High School’ (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150626070856/http:/www.cdshishi.net/its/trans.aspx?id=2608" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">石室中学</a> &lt;
broken link &gt;)&nbsp;organised a Rubik’s cube tournament for their students
on 31 May 2022 and Bendemeer Primary was invited to participate virtually
alongside the Chengdu students. Amidst our P6 students, there were some
who possessed this hidden talent and were very proficient with Rubik’s
Cube! They played a friendly match with 6 Integrity cheering on as spectators.
It was very heart-warming to see both schools sharing applause and words
of encouragement! The Chengdu school commended that one of our students
completed the Rubik’s cube puzzle in 30 seconds which was considered lightning
fast! This tournament was held in conjunction with other activities as
part of Children’s Day in China on 1 June 2022.</p>
