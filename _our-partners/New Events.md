Six of our NE Champs took part in the 2023 Civil Defence Junior Lionhearters Challenge held on 24 Feb 2023. This event was organised by the Singapore Civil Defence Force.  
  
Prior to this day, the student team spent much time and effort learning and imparting First Aid skills and knowledge among themselves, identifying where are the AEDs located in the school, completing the Community Emergency Preparedness Tier 1 Certificates and creating their own version of the SCDF Ready Bag and painted it to their own design! This bag contains essentials for use during emergencies. The challenge saw the team putting their teamwork and resilience against many other Primary schools around Singapore in solving puzzles and quizzes related to Emergency Preparedness.  
  
Although our team did not win the main challenge, we are proud to announce that the team's Ready Bag was in the top 10 schools, and they were awarded a $50 voucher! The team was very happy and excited that their efforts paid off and they had a lot of fun!

Bendemeer Primary School commemorated Total Defence Day in which staff and students remembered the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese forces 81 years ago on 15 Feb 1942.  
  
Our partners from Rochor Neighbourhood Police Centre of the Singapore Police Force showcased police vehicles and equipment to our excited and curious students! Our male staff also wore their NS uniforms and shared with our students what they did as National Servicemen.
