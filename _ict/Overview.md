### INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT)

#### VISION

Future-ready and Digitally Responsible Learners

  
#### ICT @ BPS

The ICT department strives to harness ICT to transform the teaching and learning landscape in school. Aspiring for our students to become Future-ready and Responsible Digital Learners, the school has planned various ICT programmes that have been integrated into the curriculum and subject disciplines.  These programmes aim to develop students’ competencies for self-directed and collaborative learning.

#### Programme Highlights/Enrichment Activities

##### ICT Baseline Standards
The baseline ICT standards are sets of essential skills developed to enable all students to have the necessary skills to support them in learning and to prepare them for the future needs. Students in different levels are given ICT lessons to acquire the necessary core skills to follow:

| Level 	| Core Skills 	|
|---	|---	|
| Primary 1 & Primary 2 	|   1. Learning parts of the computer – Hardware Awareness<br>  2. Learning the steps to login to school device & SLS Learning Portal<br>  3. Introduction to Touch Typing with BBC Bitesize<br>  4. Microsoft Office Word 	|
| Primary 3 & 4 	|   1. Microsoft Office PowerPoint Module<br>  2. Video Journalism 	|
| Primary 5 & 6 	|   1. Code for Fun<br>  2. Learning Micro:bit with Smart Sensors<br>  3. P6 ICT Project (Post-PSLE) 	|

##### Blended Learning during weekly HBL lessons & E Learning Days

In the digital era, it is important for our students to be equipped with the necessary knowledge, skills and dispositions to thrive in an interconnected, diverse and rapidly changing world. Hence, Blended Learning will be a key feature of the schooling experience to further develop students’ ability to be self-directed, passionate and life-long learners. Through Blended Learning, weekly HBL lessons and E- Learning Days will complement teaching and learning in schools.

The main objectives of the E-Learning are: <br>
1. To provide an alternative platform for continuous learning in case of school closure due to emergencies.<br>
2. To develop students to be self-directed and independent learners.

The school has stipulated certain days in the school’s calendar as E-Learning days as students need not attend school. They are expected to complete the online assignments found in [**SLS Portal**](/our-people/for-parents/ict-matters/student-learning-space) assigned by their subject teachers. 

  

##### Code For Fun @ BPS

The Code for Fun Enrichment Programme (offered jointly by IMDA and MOE) is offered to all MOE primary schools. The school embarked on the Code for Fun programme, for our primary 5 students since 2020.  The Code for Fun programme plays an important role in MOE’s computer Science Education roadmap.

The aim of this programme is to: 
*   develop an appreciation of core computational thinking and coding concepts through simple visual programming-based lessons ·       
*   Exposure to emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Computational thinking is a learned approach and one of the better ways to learn it, is through programming. 

This learning approach employs all the components of computational thinking and the knowledge gained through the experience of tackling programming challenges. It can provide a framework not only for computer science, but for any field from natural and health sciences, to the social sciences and humanities.

During the Code for Fun workshops, students use block-based programming to programme the Sphero Bolt and complete exciting challenges.

##### Micro:Bit Learning @ BPS

As part of the modular CCA programme, all P5 Students went through the Micro:Bits Coding Programme  to encourage innovation, foster collaboration and empower students to create with technology. Students underwent training and built Smart Homes using smart sensors. The students created innovative smart homes with the Design Thinking approach. On the last day of their training, each group presented their smart homes and shared about the sensor they had incorporated in their smart homes. This programme had provided the opportunity to develop creative and innovative citizens of tomorrow.

##### Mobile Trail @ BPS

At Bendemeer Primary School, there are many interesting learning spaces. The mobile trails came about to make these learning spaces come alive and to extend learning beyond the classroom.

  
The Mobile Trail @ BPS aims to bring about the following:

1.       **Cultivation of 21st Century Competencies** \- Mobile trails help to develop the three domains of 21st Century Competencies – Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills; Critical and Inventive Thinking; and Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills in our students.

2.       **Learning outside the classroom** – Education comes alive when we step out of the classroom and explore real world applications and scenarios around us. This makes learning authentic.

3.       **Cross-disciplinary learning** – ICT is harnessed as a tool to provide a multidisciplinary approach to learning. It helps students develop awareness that what we learn is not in isolation.

4.       **Changing face of education** – Gone are the days of frontal teaching. Mobile trails engage students in independent and self-directed learning, resulting in a student-centric learning experience. Most importantly, it makes learning fun and engaging!

The Student Learning Space (SLS) is used as the main platform for mobile trails in the school. The portal allows many different forms of assessment and embedding of external web-based applications which offer resources, tools and features to complement teaching and learning. Both teachers and students find it easy to navigate and complete the trail.
