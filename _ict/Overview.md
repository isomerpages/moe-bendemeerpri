<h3><strong>Blended Learning during Home Based Learning(HBL) lessons </strong></h3>
<p>In the digital era, it is important for our students to be equipped with
the necessary knowledge, skills and dispositions to thrive in an interconnected,
diverse and rapidly changing world. Hence, Blended Learning will be a key
feature of the schooling experience to further develop students’ ability
to be self-directed, passionate and life-long learners. Through Blended
Learning, HBL lessons will complement teaching and learning in schools.</p>
<p>The main objectives of the HBL are:
<br>1.&nbsp;To provide an alternative platform for continuous learning in
case of school closure due to emergencies.
<br>2.&nbsp;To develop students to be self-directed and independent learners.</p>
<p>The school has stipulated certain days in the school’s calendar as HBL
days as students need not attend school.&nbsp;They are expected to complete
the online assignments found in&nbsp;<strong><a href="/our-people/for-parents/ict-matters/student-learning-space" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SLS Portal</a></strong>&nbsp;assigned
by their subject teachers.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Primary 3 &amp; Primary 4 Scratch Coding Programme</strong></h3>
<p>The Primary 3 and Primary 4 Scratch Coding Programme at Bendemeer Primary
School supports the EdTech Masterplan 2030 by developing students into
digitally empowered future-ready learners.</p>
<p>Through hands-on coding using Scratch, students strengthen key MOE Digital
Competencies, learning not just <em>how</em> to use technology, but <em>why</em> and <em>how responsibly</em> it
can be applied to real-world issues.</p>
<h4><strong>Developing MOE Digital Competencies</strong></h4>
<p>Through the programme, students develop:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Computational Thinking</strong> – breaking down problems, sequencing
instructions, and debugging their code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Creative Thinking &amp; Innovation</strong> – designing original
animations and games to communicate ideas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication &amp; Collaboration</strong> – working with peers
to plan, test, and improve their projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Responsible &amp; Ethical Use of Technology</strong> – using digital
tools purposefully to promote sustainability and positive values</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Learning with Purpose</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Primary 3 students create Scratch animations centred on Zero Waste Management,
using code to advocate habits such as reducing, reusing, recycling, and
responsible consumption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primary 4 students design interactive Scratch games focused on Food Waste
Management, encouraging players to make informed and sustainable choices
about food usage and waste reduction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Preparing Students for the Future</strong></h4>
<p>By applying coding skills to authentic environmental issues, students
learn to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Think critically and solve problems systematically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persevere through trial, error, and refinement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Express ideas clearly through digital creations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See themselves as creators of technology, not just consumers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These learning experiences reflect Bendemeer Primary School’s commitment
to developing students who are confident, responsible, and purposeful users
of technology, equipped with essential digital competencies for the future.</p>
<h2><strong>Code For Fun @ BPS</strong></h2>
<p>Our Primary 5 students had an exciting and enriching experience during
the Code for Fun Programme! Through the sessions, they explored the world
of Computational Thinking and discovered how these skills can be applied
in their daily lives.</p>
<p>Students learnt basic programming concepts such as events, loops, variables,
and functions, while also strengthening their logical thinking and problem-solving
abilities by breaking big problems into smaller, manageable steps.</p>
<p>A highlight of the programme was the hands-on activity where students
worked in teams to program a dance using their Sphero robotic kits. This
engaging task not only fostered teamwork and creativity but also allowed
them to see coding come to life in a fun way!</p>
<p>The 10-hour workshop concluded with an introduction to Artificial Intelligence
(AI), sparking students’ curiosity about how technology is shaping the
future.</p>

<h2><strong>AI for Fun (AIFF)  </strong><br><strong>Primary 6 Post-Exam Programme</strong></h2>
<p>Building on this foundation, our Primary 6 students also took part in
AI for Fun (AIFF) as a post-examination enrichment programme. AIFF provides
students with meaningful and engaging learning experiences after exams,
allowing them to explore AI concepts in an age-appropriate and accessible
way.</p>
<p>Through interactive activities, students gained exposure to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How AI works in daily life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The responsible and ethical use of AI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How technology can be used to solve real-world problems</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>AIFF value-adds to students’ learning by nurturing curiosity, critical
thinking, and digital awareness, while preparing them for a future where
AI plays an increasingly important role.</p>
<p>Together, Code For Fun and AI for Fun support Bendemeer Primary School’s
commitment to developing future-ready learners who are confident, thoughtful,
and responsible users of technology.</p>
<h3><strong>Micro:Bit Learning @ BPS</strong></h3>
<p>As part of the modular CCA programme, all P5 Students went through the
Micro:Bits Coding Programme&nbsp;&nbsp;to encourage innovation, foster
collaboration and empower students to create with technology. Students
underwent training and built Smart Homes using smart sensors. The students
created innovative smart homes with the Design Thinking approach. On the
last day of their training, each group presented their smart homes and
shared about the sensor they had incorporated in their smart homes. This
programme had provided the opportunity to develop creative and innovative
citizens of tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Mobile Trail @ BPS</strong></h3>
<p>At Bendemeer Primary School, there are many interesting learning spaces.
The mobile trails came about to make these learning spaces come alive and
to extend learning beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>The Mobile Trail @ BPS aims to bring about the following:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Cultivation of 21st Century Competencies</strong>&nbsp;-
Mobile trails help to develop the three domains of 21st Century Competencies
– Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills; Critical
and Inventive Thinking; and Communication, Collaboration and Information
Skills in our students.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Learning outside the classroom</strong>&nbsp;–
Education comes alive when we step out of the classroom and explore real
world applications and scenarios around us. This makes learning authentic.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Cross-disciplinary learning</strong>&nbsp;–
ICT is harnessed as a tool to provide a multidisciplinary approach to learning.
It helps students develop awareness that what we learn is not in isolation.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Changing face of education</strong>&nbsp;–
Gone are the days of frontal teaching. Mobile trails engage students in
independent and self-directed learning, resulting in a student-centric
learning experience. Most importantly, it makes learning fun and engaging!</p>
<p>The Student Learning Space (SLS) is used as the main platform for mobile
trails in the school. The portal allows many different forms of assessment
and embedding of external web-based applications which offer resources,
tools and features to complement teaching and learning. Both teachers and
students find it easy to navigate and complete the trail.</p>
<h3><strong>DigitalAccess@Home</strong></h3>
<p>DigitalAccess@Home provides subsidised broadband and laptops/tablets to
lower-income households to support their lifestyle needs, including work
and social activities.</p>
