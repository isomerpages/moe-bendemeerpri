<h3>INFORMATION COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY (ICT)</h3>
<h4>VISION</h4>
<p>Future-ready and Digitally Responsible Learners</p>
<h4>ICT @ BPS</h4>
<p>The ICT department strives to harness ICT to transform the teaching and
learning landscape in school. Aspiring for our students to become&nbsp;Future-ready
and Responsible Digital Learners, the school has&nbsp;planned various ICT
programmes that have been integrated into the curriculum and subject disciplines.&nbsp;
These programmes aim to develop students’ competencies for self-directed
and collaborative learning.</p>
<h4>Programme Highlights/Enrichment Activities</h4>
<h5>ICT Baseline Standards</h5>
<p>The baseline ICT standards are sets of essential skills developed to enable
all students to have the necessary skills to support them in learning and
to prepare them for the future needs. Students in different levels are
given ICT lessons to acquire the necessary core skills to follow:</p>

<h5>Blended Learning during weekly HBL lessons (Learning via SLS)</h5>
<p>In the digital era, it is important for our students to be equipped with
the necessary knowledge, skills and dispositions to thrive in an interconnected,
diverse and rapidly changing world. Hence, Blended Learning will be a key
feature of the schooling experience to further develop students’ ability
to be self-directed, passionate and life-long learners. Through Blended
Learning, weekly HBL lessons (LvS) will complement teaching and learning
in schools.</p>
<p>The main objectives of the HBL are:
<br>1.&nbsp;To provide an alternative platform for continuous learning in
case of school closure due to emergencies.
<br>2.&nbsp;To develop students to be self-directed and independent learners.</p>
<p>The school has stipulated certain days in the school’s calendar as HBL
days as students need not attend school.&nbsp;They are expected to complete
the online assignments found in&nbsp;<strong><a href="/our-people/for-parents/ict-matters/student-learning-space" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SLS Portal</a></strong>&nbsp;assigned
by their subject teachers.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Code For Fun @ BPS</h5>
<p></p>
<p>Our Primary 5 students had an exciting and enriching experience during
the Code for Fun Programme! Through the sessions, they explored the world
of Computational Thinking and discovered how these skills can be applied
in their daily lives.</p>
<p>Students learnt basic programming concepts such as events, loops, variables,
and functions, while also strengthening their logical thinking and problem-solving
abilities by breaking big problems into smaller, manageable steps.</p>
<p>A highlight of the programme was the hands-on activity where students
worked in teams to program a dance using their Sphero robotic kits. This
engaging task not only fostered teamwork and creativity but also allowed
them to see coding come to life in a fun way!</p>
<p>The 10-hour workshop concluded with an introduction to Artificial Intelligence
(AI), sparking students’ curiosity about how technology is shaping the
future.</p>

<h5>Micro:Bit Learning @ BPS</h5>
<p>As part of the modular CCA programme, all P5 Students went through the
Micro:Bits Coding Programme&nbsp;&nbsp;to encourage innovation, foster
collaboration and empower students to create with technology. Students
underwent training and built Smart Homes using smart sensors. The students
created innovative smart homes with the Design Thinking approach. On the
last day of their training, each group presented their smart homes and
shared about the sensor they had incorporated in their smart homes. This
programme had provided the opportunity to develop creative and innovative
citizens of tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Mobile Trail @ BPS</h5>
<p>At Bendemeer Primary School, there are many interesting learning spaces.
The mobile trails came about to make these learning spaces come alive and
to extend learning beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>The Mobile Trail @ BPS aims to bring about the following:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Cultivation of 21st Century Competencies</strong>&nbsp;-
Mobile trails help to develop the three domains of 21st Century Competencies
– Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills; Critical
and Inventive Thinking; and Communication, Collaboration and Information
Skills in our students.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Learning outside the classroom</strong>&nbsp;–
Education comes alive when we step out of the classroom and explore real
world applications and scenarios around us. This makes learning authentic.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Cross-disciplinary learning</strong>&nbsp;–
ICT is harnessed as a tool to provide a multidisciplinary approach to learning.
It helps students develop awareness that what we learn is not in isolation.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Changing face of education</strong>&nbsp;–
Gone are the days of frontal teaching. Mobile trails engage students in
independent and self-directed learning, resulting in a student-centric
learning experience. Most importantly, it makes learning fun and engaging!</p>
<p>The Student Learning Space (SLS) is used as the main platform for mobile
trails in the school. The portal allows many different forms of assessment
and embedding of external web-based applications which offer resources,
tools and features to complement teaching and learning. Both teachers and
students find it easy to navigate and complete the trail.</p>
<p><strong>DigitalAccess@Home</strong>
</p>
<p>DigitalAccess@Home provides subsidised broadband and laptops/tablets to
lower-income households to support their lifestyle needs, including work
and social activities.</p>
