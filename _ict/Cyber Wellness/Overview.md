### CYBER WELLNESS

#### What is Cyber Wellness?

Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. CW helps students to become responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, students should demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible use. Students should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive use of technology for the good of the community. (Adapted from MOE CW)

In Bendemeer Primary School, we are committed to equip our students with the skills to stay cyber-smart. In turn, they can become responsible netizens who will take responsibility for their actions online and protect themselves from online threats. CW activities are planned according to the three principles listed in the MOE CW Framework: ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’.  
  
The school believes CW can be advocated effectively and meaningfully using a bottom-up initiation - the CW movement should be initiated by our pupils instead of teachers. Thus, we emphasised on the "why" behind CW and show our pupils how they can be a CW agent of change to make the cyberspace a better place. With this approach, our pupils internalise the importance of CW and have a strong sense of ownership towards maintaining and advocating CW.

Cyber Wellness is promoted in school through:

*   Termly Assembly Programme
*   Bite-sized Cyber Wellness Sharing during Pre-assembly
*   Sharing of CW tips using the TV Messaging System during recess
*   Leveraging on FTGP as a platform to share key messages in Cyber Wellness

#### Cyber Wellness Ambassador Programme @ Bendemeer Primary School

##### Yearly Training for Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors

Primary 3 to Primary 6 students who are selected as the Cyber Wellness Student Ambassador (CWSA) of their class attend a training session where teachers equip them with information on CW. As CW ambassadors, they are expected to promote and raise cyber wellness awareness among their peers. They actively support the school’s cyber wellness programme in helping to conduct and create cyber wellness learning resources such as games, puzzles and posters.
