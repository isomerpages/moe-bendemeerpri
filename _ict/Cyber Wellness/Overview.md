<h3>CYBER WELLNESS</h3>
<h4>What is Cyber Wellness?</h4>
<p>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users.
It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to
protect oneself in cyberspace. CW helps students to become responsible
digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, students should demonstrate
respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible use. Students
should&nbsp;also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology
for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive
use of technology for the good of the community. (Adapted from MOE CW)</p>

<p>In Bendemeer Primary School, we are committed to equip our students with
the skills to stay cyber-smart. In turn, they can become responsible netizens
who will take responsibility for their actions online and protect themselves
from online threats. CW activities are planned according to the three principles
listed in the MOE CW Framework: ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and
Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’.</p>
<p>The school believes CW can be advocated effectively and meaningfully using
a bottom-up initiation - the CW movement should be initiated by our pupils
instead of teachers. Thus, we emphasised on the "why" behind CW and show
our pupils how they can be a CW agent of change to make the cyberspace
a better place. With this approach, our pupils internalise the importance
of CW and have a strong sense of ownership towards maintaining and advocating
CW.</p>
<p>Cyber Wellness is promoted in school through:</p>

<h4>Cyber Wellness Ambassador Programme @ Bendemeer Primary School</h4>
<h5>Yearly Training for Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors</h5>
<p>Primary 3 to Primary 6 students who are selected as the Cyber Wellness
Student Ambassador (CWSA) of their class attend a training session where
teachers equip them with information on CW. As CW ambassadors, they are
expected to promote and raise cyber wellness awareness among their peers.
They actively support the school’s cyber wellness programme in helping
to conduct and create cyber wellness learning resources such as games,
puzzles and posters.</p>
