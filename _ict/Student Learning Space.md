<h3>STUDENT LEARNING SPACE</h3>
<h5>About SLS</h5>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/login" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SLS</a>&nbsp;is
an online learning portal providing equal access to quality curriculum-aligned
resources, in line with the development of&nbsp;21st Century Competencies
(21CC).
<br>The SLS also provides teachers with a range of tools to customise and
create meaningful learning experiences that cater to diverse learning needs.
For example, teachers have access to tools that help to make students’
thinking processes visible. This enables teachers to make informed decisions
and provide targeted intervention to address any gaps in understanding.</p>
<p>The SLS also serves as a common online platform for teachers to apply,
adapt and share new pedagogies by facilitating collaborations across classrooms
and schools.</p>
<p>The SLS is continually being developed in response to the needs of students
and teachers. Curriculum-aligned resources and system tools are continually
being improved and developed in line with suggestions and feedback from
teachers and students to cater to students’ diverse and evolving learning
needs.</p>
